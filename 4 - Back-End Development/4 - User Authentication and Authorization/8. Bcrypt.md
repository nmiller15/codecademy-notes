# Bcrypt

Using bcrypt we can *hash* *and salt* the passwords that we store in our database. The bcrypt algorithm uses multiple rounds of hashing to ensure that any attacker but deploy massive funds and hardware to crack a password.

## Hash Functions

- Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm that uses a combination of salt, rounds, and a key to keep passwords secure
- To check passwords, since hashes are a one-way operation, we hash the password that the user tried to enter and ensure that it matches the stored value.

## Salts and Rainbow Table Attacks

- This is not perfectly secure, hackers can still access passwords if they crack the database by using rainbow tables, these are large lookup databases that consist of pre=computed password-hash combinations which correlate plaintext passwords with their hashes
- Rainbow tables consist of two different types of functions:
   - A hashing function: used to match the hashed password
   - A reduction function: to transform a hash into something usable as a password, this does not output the original plaintext, but instead outputs a completely new one
- To mitigate rainbow table attacks, we can use a salt which is a random value that is added to the input of a hashing function in order to make each password hash unique, even if two users choose the same password.

## Using bcrypt to Hash Passwords

```javascript
// Two arguments, the plaintext password and the rounds of salt
// Asyncronous because the operation may take time
const passwordHash = async (password, saltRounds) => {
  // try catch to handle errors
  try {
    // generate a salt with bcrypt, put in a number to specify the rounds
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds);
    // use .hash() to create the hashed password
    return await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  // If there is an error with bcrypt then we return null
  return null;
};
```

## Verifying Passwords

1. Retrieve plain text password.
2. Hash the password.
3. Compare the hashed password with the hash stored in the database.

```javascript
bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
```

```javascript
const comparePasswords = async (password, hash) => {
  try {
    const matchFound = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
    return matchFound;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  return false;
};
```

## Bcrypt in a CRUD App

Example of registering a user:

```javascript
app.post("/register", (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  
  // HASHING PASSWORD
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
  const newUser = {
    email,
    password: hash
  };
  // HASHING PASSWORD
  
  await user.save();
  // Create a new user object to store in the database:
  user = new User({
    email,
    password
    });
  // Save user in database:
  await user.save();
  res.redirect("login");
});
```

Example of logging the existing user in:

```javascript
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  let user = await User.findOne({ email: email });
  // If passwords don't match, redirect client back to the login page:
  // Use bcrypt to hash the retrieved password and compare it to hash stored 
  // in database:
  const matchedPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

  // If passwords match, redirect client along with the user object:
  res.render("profile", { user });
});
```

- `bcrypt.compare()` pulls the salt out of the hashed password so that it can be compared
