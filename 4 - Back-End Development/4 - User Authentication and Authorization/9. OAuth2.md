# OAuth 2.0

There are three ways that a website can give you access after you log in. These three will be detailed below.

## HTTP Basic Auth

- This is the oldest and simplest method of authentication. It requires the username and password of the user to be sent with each request (typically through cookies).

## API Keyps

- Instead of the username and password, a long and random string is used to authorize interactions. These are more often used by developers to authenticate scripts or applications.
- These tend to be too complex for daily personal use.

## OAuth

- This is the ability to sign in using a different account like Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, or even Github
- Here's how it works:
   1. Redirect User to Provider for Authentication
   2. User Grants Authorization - without passing credentials back to original site
   3. Redirect User to Application
   4. Exchange for Access Grant - Original site requests an access token from provider api
   5. Grant Access Token - provider generates access token
   6. Create Connection - access token grants permission

## OAuth Tokens

### Access Tokens

Access tokens are essentially API keys that are included with requests, authenticating a user. These keys are short-lived: anywhere from a few-minutes to a few hours which limits the window of time that an attacker can use a stolen token.

There are also *refresh tokens* which are longer lived and used by applications to get new access tokens without making the user sign in again. They can also expire and be revoked by the authorization server.

## OAuth 2.0 Grant Types

Grant types, or flows are different ways that a user can obtain access tokens. They are typically described in two parts:

   - Redirection of the user to the OAuth provider to obtain an access token.
   - Use of the access token to gain restricted access

### Client Credentials Grant

- Application requests and application token to access their own resources. Only used when resource and authentication servers are the same entity.

### Authorization Code Grant

- Most widely used for public applications
- Webserver must be able to securely store client credentials
- Uses browser redirection to communicate between the resource server and the authorization server.
- Client gets auth code and exchanges it for access token

### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

- extension to authorization code grant
- prevents attacks and secures the OAuth exchange blocking authorization code injection from malicious actors

### Implicit Grant - Deprecated

- similar to auth code grant
- might still be seen in legacy code

### Device Code Grant

- used on devices that don't have a browser or have limited input capability, like a smart TV app

### Resource Owner Password Credential Grant - Deprecated

## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0

- OAuth 1 is more complex for developers to implement that 2.0 and it disrupts UX on mobile applications by pushing users to a browser.
- OAuth 2 trades some of the additional cryptography of OAuth1 for easier implementation and a better UX since HTTPS is already encrypted.

## Threats to OAuth

- OAuth doesn't store passwords, so even if data is breached, there's no threat of massive break ins.
- A malicious website could set up OAuth to steal access to an OAuth provider and if the user is social engineered into granting access this can be dangerous.
