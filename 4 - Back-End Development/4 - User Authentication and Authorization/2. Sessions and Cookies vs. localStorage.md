# Session and Cookies vs. localStorage

## Web Sessions

- HTTP(S) on its own is statless, which means that the requests and responses do not inherently know or retain information.
- A **web session** is a series of user interactions over a time frame.
- Session data is stored server-side and associated with a session ID.
- Sessions are essentially short-term memory for a web application.

## Sessions and Cookies

- A **cookie** is a tiny piece of data (max 4kb) that is kept by the client to retain information about the session. Cookies are set by HTTP response headers in key-value pairs.

```plaintext
Set-Cookie: Key=Value

Set-Cookie: sessionId=34jgL79b
```

Here is a general flow of how cookies might work on a website:

1. User accesses site and the web server creates a session and a session ID.
2. The server response tells the browser to store a cookie with the session ID (does not include sensitive personal information)
3. The session ID cookie automatically attaches to each subsequent HTTP request to the server.
4. When the server reads the session ID cookie sent with the next HTTP request, it returns the session data associated with the ID.
5. The process continues as long as the session is active.
6. The session and session ID cookie expires after a user closes out the browser, logs out or a predetermined session length (i.e. an hour) passes.

## Cookie Security

Cookies will sometimes store information that is sensitive or personal to the user, and it must stay secure. (This contradicts what I said eariler). But, there are some ways that we can keep this information out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have it. The first way is through adding an expiration date for the cookie which is set through the `Set-Cookie` header:

### Expiration

```plaintext
Set-Cookie: Key=Value; expires=Saturday, 01-May-2021 07:30:10 GMT
```

Another way is the HttpOnly attribute for `Set-Cookie` which keeps the cookie's data inaccessible for client-side scripting. This prevents XSS or Cross Site Scripting.

### HTTP Only

```plaintext
Set-Cookie: Key=Value; expires=Saturday, 01-May-2021 07:30:10 GMT; HTTPOnly
```

Some other Set-Cookie options are:

- `SameSite` which prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- `Secure` which ensures cookies can only be sent over HTTPS requests

## What is localStorage?

Cookies were the only way to store data outside the database until HTML5, but now we have two options for this. `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` . Both of these store information in Key=Value pairs and they largely share the same syntax.

`localStorage` is the newer form of client-side storage.

- can store up to 5MB
- does not interact with teh server
- accessed and modified why JavaScript client-side
- persists after browser is exited and until the browser cache is deleted

`sessionStorage`

- holds data about the session
- clears once the browser closes
- Since the information doesn’t persist, this can be more secure

```javascript
// Set a value in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

// Get a value from localStorage
localStorage.getItem('key');
```

## Cookies // localStorage // sessionStorage

There are a number of differences between the three different client data storage options, but the largest one is that Cookies are intended to be read and interpreted by the server, while localStorage and sessionStorage are not.

The server likes to eat cookies. The client needs somewhere to store information for later.

## More On Session Security

Here are a few methods you can use to prevent session hijacking - another user stealing credentials to be authenticated as a different user.

### Define Session Expiry

- The shorter the session, the more secure. Automatic session expiration on the cookie and on the backend are both important.
- Use a timeout to determine how long a session can remain open. Think about how a bank website will timeout on idle.

### Make Session IDs Difficult to Hack

- Make session IDs longer and more random so that they can't be brute-forced. They are essentially difficult passwords.
- Ensure IDs don’t contain personally identifying information and that the algorithm to generate and ID isn’t a predicted pattern.

### Securing Cookies

- Use `Secure` `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes in the `Set-Cookie` header

### Enforce HTTPS
