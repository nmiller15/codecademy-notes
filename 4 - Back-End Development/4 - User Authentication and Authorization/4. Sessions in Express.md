# Sessions in Express

## Installing express-session

```other
$ npm install express-session
```

```javascript
const session = require("express-session")
```

We implement this as middleware in express

Once this is mounted, each user will have a unique session generated that will allow us to store session data server-side.

## express-session Configuration

We configure express-session using a configuration object

`secret` - a key used to signed and/or encrypt cookies to protect the session ID

`resave` - takes a boolean value. "true" forces a session to be saved back to the session data store even if no data was modified. typically should be "false"

`seveUninitialized` - boolean value: "true" causes the server to store every new session, even if there are no changes which could track recurring visits from the same browser, but "false" saves space in memory

We can set these values like this

```javascript
app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'D5j43nfFF',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitalized: false,
  })
)
```

Note: `secret` s should not typically be hard coded into the file, but rather should be a randomly generated string that is stored in an environment variable

## Storing Session Data

There are three ways we can store session data:

- In memory (default)
- In a database (MongoDB or MySQL something like that)
- A memory cache like Redis or Memcached

When a request from a client includes a valid session id the server will fetch the session information

Create a new store:

```javascript
const store = new session.MemoryStore();

// We also have to add this to the configuration of our session
app.use(
  session({
    secret: secret,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store,
  })
)
```

Note: Storing in-memory sessions is something that should be done only during development, NOT during production due to security risks.

## Authentication and Sessions: Cookies

Utilizing the client's storage to keep a session ID that will be sent back with its HTTP requests

```javascript
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "f4z4gs$Gcg",
    cookie: { maxAge: 1000 * 60 *60 * 24, secure: true, sameSite: "none" },
    saveUninitialized: false,
    resave: false,
  })
);
```

The cookie is stored on the client-side.

## Sessions and Authentication: Logging In

Now that sessions are implemented, we can access their properties in our code.

```javascript
// Look up user in database, if found, confirm password:
if (password == "codec@demy10") {
  // Attach an `authenticated` property to our session:
  req.session.authenticated = true;
  // Attach a user object to our session:
  req.session.user= {
    username,
    password,
  }
}

// Note: Passwords should always be encrypted, not hard-coded nor
// stored in clear text.
```

## Accessing Session Data

When the data in a session is stored, it is serialized as JSON so we can access the data as objects.

One common use case, to check whether someone is authorized to view a certain page, is given below:

```javascript
function authorizedUser(req, res, next) {
  // Check for the authorized property within the session
  if (req.session.authorized) {
    // next middleware function is invoked
    res.next();
  else {
    res.status(403).json({ msg: "You're not authorized to view this page" });
  }
};

app.get("/protected", authorizedUser, (req, res, next) => {
 res.render("protected", { "user": req.session.user });
});
// res.render takes a view page as its first argument
// and an object that defines local variables for the second
```
