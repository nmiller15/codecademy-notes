# Introduction to Swagger Tooling

Swagger is a set of open source tools that are used to develop, test, and visualize an API.

Swagger is designed to help us implement OpenAPI 3.0 Specification.

## Swagger Editor

The editor tool is used to design, define and document RESTful APIs and accepts different OpenAPI versions by creating a contract.

## Swagger Codegen

Using the API specification, Codegen will generate the code and documentation from the provided contract.

## Swagger UI

Creates documnetation from the contract that allows an end user to see the endpoints and functionality of the API without any code or implementation logic in place.
