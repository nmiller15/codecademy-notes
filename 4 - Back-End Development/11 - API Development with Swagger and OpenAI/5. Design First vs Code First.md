# Design First vs Code First

## Introduction

The two schools of thought, “Design first” and “Code first” refer to the development part of the API lifecycle. Either one occurs after the planning phase of the API.

**Design first** - API plan is converted into a human and machine-readable contract from which the code is built

**Code First** - based on a business plan, an API is directly coded, from which a human and machine-readable document is generated

**API contract -** A document typically in a human and machine readable language that describes the API capabilities, endpoints and finer details. Can serve as both the plan and the documentation

In *design* first, the contract is a blueprint, in the *code* first, the contract is primarily documentation

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Design First Approach

- When Developer Experience Matters
   - If the strategy involves a need for high adoption and retentition of users integrating with the API, then DX matters
- When Delivering Mission Critical APIs
- When Ensuring Good Communication

### Code First Approach

- When Speedy Delivery Matters
- When Developing Internal APIs
