# Introduction to the API Development Lifecycle

## What is the API development lifecycle?

Typically the lifecycle follows these steps:

1. ### Planning and Designing the API

The API is typically broken down into the functions that it needs to perform and the data that it needs to expose is discussed and mapped.

2. ### Developing the API

The development of the API will occur once the plan is in place. This is also trpically when the documentation happens. This is especially true when the API itself is considered a product. Many APIs are exposed and limited to free and paid versions.

3. ### Testing the API

Each endpoint and function of the API will be tested before given to end users.

4. ### Deploying and Managing the API

This is the main chunk of the lifecycle if it is a longstanding API. There may be phases to deployment, like a beta-test to a smaller subset to ensure that everything is functional

5. ### Retiring the API

This is the discontinuation of support. This will involve mirgrating users away and removing the resources of the API.

Once an API is long-standing, many applications and systems may depend on it, so retirement must be carefully thought through.
