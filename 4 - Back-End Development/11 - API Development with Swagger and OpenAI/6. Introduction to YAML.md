# Introduction to YAML

“Yet Another Markup Language” ⇒ ”YAML Ain't Markup Language”

Emphasis on human readability and is incresingly relied upon for configuration files, log files, debgging data structures, interprocess messaging, and cross-language data sharing.

Often compared to JSON, however, has a more human-readable syntax.

## YAML Structure

```yaml
---
# Our first YAML document
bottle: wine
capitals:
  Japan: Tokyo
  Argentina: Buenos Aires
oceans:
  - Indian
  - Atlantic
  - Arctic
  - Pacific
...
```

`---` - all YAML documents begin with three dashes

`…`  - all YAML documents end with three dots

`#` - comments

YAML is mostly mappings that are defined as key-value pairs. These can be nested as is the case with `capitals` .

Whitespace is the primary syntax of YAML, line breaks indicate a new mapping, indents represent nested structures.

Filetype extension is either `.yml` or `.yaml`

## Sequences

Sequences (see `oceans`) are typically displayed on multiple lines and can contain a mix of data types. They can also be written as `oceans: [Indians, Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific]`

## Scalars

All remaining data types in YAML are scalars, single value data types:

```yaml
scalars:
  - 1            # Integer (number)
  - 1.0          # Float   (number)
  - True         # Boolean (True, On, Yes) (False, Off, No)
  - null         # Null (null, Null, NULL, ~)
  - "string"     # String - typically quotes aren't needed except:
                 #      - when string would be evaluated differently by default
                 #      - to escape literals like \n to break a line
```
