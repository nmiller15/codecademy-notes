# Suggested Project Structure

[node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/guides/project-structure)

It is suggested that all of the interactions with the database should be performed by functions in a separate file. This allows for changes to the API without having to track down the locations where they were used in the files structure.

Location of the access file can be just about anywhere, but it really depends on the application

Instead of requireing pg and Pool in every file that needs to access the database, the file is just required as `db`

```javascript
// db/index.js
import pg from 'pg'
const { Pool } = pg
 
const pool = new Pool()
 
export const query = (text, params, callback) => {
  return pool.query(text, params, callback)
}
```

```javascript
// routes/user.js

// notice here I'm requiring my database adapter file
// and not requiring node-postgres directly
import * as db from '../db/index.js'
 
app.get('/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [req.params.id])
  res.send(result.rows[0])
})
 
// ... many other routes in this file
```
