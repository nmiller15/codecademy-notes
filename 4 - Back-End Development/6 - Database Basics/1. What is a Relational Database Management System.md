# What is a Relational Database Management System?

- A databse is a set of data stored in a computer. It is typically structured in a way to make it accessible
- A relational database uses a specific structure that allows data to be identified and accessed in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often a table

## Tables: Rows and Columns

- Typically many rows - each row is also called a record.
- Columns have a descriptive name, and also have a specific data type
- A RDBMS is a program that allows you to create, update, and dminister a relational database. Most will use SQL to access the database.

## What is SQL?

- Strucutred Query Lanuage - used to access data in tables
- There are many different versions and flavors and adaptations to SQL
   - SQLite - a miniamal set of commands

## Popular Relational Database Management Systems

MySQL

- most popular open source SQL database
- web app development, accessing PHP
- Easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community
- Known to take performance hits when scaling, since Oracle took over open source development slowed, doesnâ€™t include advanced features

PostgreSQL

- open source with no controlling corp
- web app development
- many of the same advantages as MySQL, foreign key support
- can be slower, slightly less popular

Oracle DB

- not open source, owned by Oracle
- large applications, banking
- has pre-built and pre-integrated business applications
- expensive

SQL Server

- Microsoft owned, not open source
- Large applications
- free entry-level version (Express)
- expensive to scale

SQLite

- open source, stores entire databse in a single file
- all data can be stored locally
- cellphones, mobile devices

## Using PostgreSQL and SQLite Differences

- [Difference] - <PostgreSQL> // <SQLite>
- File extensions - `.sql`  // `.sqlite`
- Data types -
   - text - [`varchar(n)` `char(n)` `text` ] //  `TEXT`
- Built-in tables: All syntax will be different based on RDBMS
