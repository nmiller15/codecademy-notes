# Introduction to NoSQL

- "Not Only SQL" but also called "non-relational" or "non-SQL"
- Any database tech that is different from a relational database is a NoSQL databse

## Is NoSQL the Right Option?

### Benefits

- Designed with scalability in mind
- Very flexible, no schema required
- Allows developers to focus on the data itself rather than how to store it

### Drawbacks

- Mostly not ACID compliant, but they can be. Integrity of data is a concern
- No standardized language for accessing

## Types of NoSQL

### Key-Value

- One key to one value, and all keys must be unique.
- Ideal for simple data and fast queries
- Amazon DynamoDB and Redis

### Document

- Hierarchical structured data in document formats (JSON, BSON, XML, YAML)
- Very flexible and can model relationships
- MongoDB

### Graph

- Data stored in a graph structure, organized in nodes and relationships
- Simpler than a relational databse
- Neo4j

### Column Oriented

- Data is stored as columns instead of rows, otherwise similar to relational database
- faster read speeds for comparing columns and aggregating data
   - Only need to pull one column to get totals rather than in a row-oriented where we have to pull every row
- Amazon Redshift
