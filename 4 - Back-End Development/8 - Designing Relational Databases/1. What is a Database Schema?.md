# What is a Databse Schema

## Introduction

A database scheuma is documnetation that helps designers, administrators and other users interact with a databse by definining the purpose, data, tables, internal structure of the tables, and the relationships of a database.

Schema can be designed on paper or with software like the following:

A schema should include

- table names
- column names in a table with data types
- contraints per table
- relationships between tables

## Identifying and Creating your Tables

Tables should contain only information for one kind of thing, and attempt to be limited in size and scope. If there is a way to remove data from one to be stored in another and replaced with a key if necessary, this should be done.

Once you have created your schema, you can create a databse with the PostgreSQL syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
  first_name varchar(15),
  last_name varchar(15),
  age integer,
  ...
  ssn char(9)
);
```

In Postgres, the data types are different from SQLite, they are as follows:

- integer - whole number
- decimal - floating-point number
- money - fixed floating-point with 2 decimal places
- boolean - logic
- char(n) - fixed-length string removing trailing blanks
- varchar(n) - variable-length string
- text - unlimited-length string

## Querying Your Tables

To add data with PostgreSQL syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (
  column_one_value,
  column_two_value,
  â€¦
  column_N_value
);
```

## Relationships Between Tables

When thinking about relationships between rows and tables, we have to consider

- Can only one be matched with each row on this table?
- Can this table have multiple matches for its rows?
