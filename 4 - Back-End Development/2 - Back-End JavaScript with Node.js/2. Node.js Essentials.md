# Node.js Essentials

### The Events Module

- Event-driven architecture is giving the computer a set of instructions to execute to handle specific actions. Instead of a predefined order, events are handled.
- Node provides an `EventEmitter` class that can be accessed through requiring the `events` core module.

```javascript
// Require 'events' core module
let events = require('events');

// Create an instance of the EventEmitter class
let myEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

let newUserListener = (data) => {
  console.log(`We have a new user: ${data}.`)
}

// newUserListener is set as the callback for 'new user' event
myEmitter.on('new user', newUserListener)

// 'new user' event is emitted, using the name 'lily pad'
myEmitter.emit('new user', 'Lily Pad');
```

- `.on()`  method ties an event to listen for to a callback function
- `.emit()` method creates or "emits" that event with an argument of data that will be passed to the assigned callback function

### User Input/Output

- In Node, the basic input output system is the terminal.
- We can get output from using `console.log()` which is what is called a "thin wrapper" for Node's `process.stdout()` method "process, standard output"

```javascript
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
  let input = userInput.toString()
  console.log(input);
})
```

- `process.stdin()` is an instance of the `EventEmitter` class, so we can use the `.on()` method with it. This code will log a user input to the console after converting it to a string.
- User inputs from the terminal are actually instances of the Buffer class which is bytes. So to use it normally, we need to convert it to a string.

### The Error Module

- The Node environment has a built in `error` module that contains all the standard JavaScript errors and the `Error` class.
- The `error` module is global, so it doesn't need to be imported.
- In synchronous code, we can use error handling like `tryâ€¦catch` statements, but in async code many API's use *error-first callback functions* like below:

```javascript
const errorFirstCallback = (err, data)  => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(`There WAS an error: ${err}`);
  } else {
    // err was falsy
    console.log(`There was NO error. Event data: ${data}`);
  }
}
```

- In this instance, if the task results in an error, it will be passed as the first argument, and if there is no error, the first argument will be `undefined`

### The Buffer Module

- Another globally scoped module is `Buffer` which handles binary data.
- A `Buffer` object is a fixed size of memory that cannot be altered, it can be thought of as an array of integers where each value is a byte. Each integer can have a value between 0 and 255 inclusive.
- Buffer methods:
   - `.alloc()`  creates a new `Buffer` object with:
      - size - specified by the first parameter*
      - fill - a value to fill the buffer with (defaults to 0)
      - encoding - (defaults to utf-8)
   - `.toString()` converts Buffer to human-readable string, contains three optional arguments
      - encoding: def - utf-8
      - start: what byte to start translating (zero indexed)
      - end: offset to end translating (zero indexed)
   - `.from()` create a new `Buffer` object from the specified string, array or buffer
      - Object* - this will fill the buffer
      - encoding - def utf-8
   - `.concat()` joins buffer objects passed in an array into one
      - Array* - of `Buffer` objects
      - Length

```javascript
// Allocate buffer of size 15 filled with 'b'
const bufferAlloc = Buffer.alloc(15, 'b')

// Create buffer1 with 'hello' and buffer2 with 'world'
const buffer1 = Buffer.from('hello');
const buffer2 = Buffer.from('world');

// Combine buffer1 and buffer2
const bufferArray = [buffer1, buffer2];
const bufferConcat = Buffer.concat(bufferArray);

// Translate buffer to string
const bufferString = bufferConcat.toString();

// Uncomment the appropriate `console.log()` to ouput to console
//console.log(bufferAlloc);
//console.log('Buffer 1:', buffer1, 'Buffer 2:', buffer2)
//console.log(bufferConcat);
console.log(bufferString);
```

### The FS Module

- In back end applications, it is necessary to have access to the file system which we can access through the **fs** API.
- Applications can be segmented, isolated, or *sandboxed*, to protect users from malicious programs.
- All of the `fs` methods have synchronous and asynchronous versions

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

let readDataCallback = (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(`Something went wrong: ${err}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Provided file contained: ${data}`);
  }
};

fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', readDataCallback)
```

- Uses the `.readFile()` method with an error first callback that will log the contents of the given file to the console.

### Readable Streams

- A stream is a piece of data that is being processed sequentially rather than all at once.
- Using streams, we can read and write to files line by line.
- `readline.createInterface()` - core module and method to read files line-by-line

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');
const fs = require('fs');

const myInterface = readline.createInterface({
  input: fs.createReadStream('text.txt')
});

myInterface.on('line', (fileLine) => {
  console.log(`The line read: ${fileLine}`);
});
```

   - Code Walkthrough:
      1. Require readline module and fs module
      2. Set `myInferface` to the result of calling the `.createInterface()` method of `readline`
      3. Pass an object to `readline` with an input of `fs.createReadStream('text.txt')` which creates a stream from the file passed to it.
      4. Assign an anonymous listener callback to execute when `line` events are emitted. (These are emitted after each line from the file is read)
      5. Log's the line of the file to the console.

### Writeable Streams

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

fileStream.write('This is the first line!'); 
fileStream.write('This is the second line!');
fileStream.end();
```

- The output file for this code is `output.txt`

### The Timers Module

- The `timers` module is global and does not need to be required.
- timer functions:
   - `setTimeout()`
   - `setInterval()`
   - `setImmediate()` - execute the callback after the current poll phase is completed
      - callback function*
      - arguments for that function
- When the timers in Node.js are added to the Node.js event loop. So they're scheduled and put into a queue that is processed at every event loop iteration.
