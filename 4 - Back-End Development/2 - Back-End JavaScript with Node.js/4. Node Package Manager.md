# Node Package Manager

- NPM or the node package manager is the most popular package manager and it is the default for Node.js
- A package manager allows you to download modules that other developers have created and made available to download, saving you time.
- When a package is installed, it automatically updates the `package.json` file which lists which packages have been installed and the version.
- This file can be quickly read and the project *dependencies* insalled by running `npm i` , i being short for `install` and all of the necessary packages will be installed
   - There are also `devDependencies` which are only used for development purposes. If you don't want to install the development dependencies, run `npm i --production`
- To initialize a Node app that keeps track of these in a package
   - `npm init` or `npm init -y`
- To install a development dependency:
   - `npm install nodemon --save-dev` or `npm install [package-name] --save-dev`
- It is also useful to install global packages, like `http-server` which will let you spin up a server in your terminal. We may want access to this globally:
   - `npm install http-server -g`
   - The "-g" is for Global and it will make the package available on the system
- Don't store your local node_modules in a shared repo, it is not necessary so long as there is a `package.json` file
