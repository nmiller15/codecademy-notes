# Aggregate Functions

## Introduction

SQL queries can also perform calculations on data to answer questions. When calculations are performed across multiple rows they are called *aggregates*.

## Count

To find out how many rows are in a table, use the `COUNT()` function with the name of a column as an argument.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
```

## Sum

To add all values in a column, use the `SUM()` function with a column name as an argument.

```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

## Max / Min

To find the highest and lowest values in a column, use the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions.

```sql
SELECT MAX(downlaods)
FROM fake_apps;
```

## Average

To calculate the average of a column, use the `AVG()` function with a column name as an argument.

```sql
SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
```

## Round

To round the results in a column to a number of decimal places, use the `ROUND()` function with a column name and an integer representing the number of decimal places to round to.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
```

```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;
```

## Group By

To aggregate data that only has certain characteristics, use `GROUP BY` .

Instead of:

```sql
SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 1999;

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2000;

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2001;
```

Use `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT year, 
  AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

Should be used with aggregate functions with a `SELECT` statement to arrange identical data into groups. Must come after any `WHERE` statements, but before `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT` .

To `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imbd_rating), 
  COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

Can also use column references. Pass an integer, indexed starting at 1, to represent a selected column.

```sql
SELECT ROUNT(imdb_rating),
  COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

## Having

To filter groups to display (like `WHERE` but for `GROUP BY` , use `HAVING` followed by a condition.

```sql
SELECT year, genre, COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;
```
