# ACID Properties

## What is a transaction?

Any unit of work done to a database is called a transaction. They can be many steps and often define changes to the database. To reduce errors we should maintain ACID properties.

## What are ACID Properties?

Atomic

Consistent

Isolated

Durable

### An Atomic Database Transaction

"all changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation. That is, all the changes are performed, or none of them are." - IBM

If even one task in the transaction fails, the whole transaction should fail.

### A Consistent Database Transaction

A consistent transaction is one that follows rules that are defined for the transaction. IBM says that consistency as "data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends." Each transaction needs to follow the rules and constraints for the database.

### Isolation in a Database

This refers to two transactions not interfering with one another. The processing of one trnasaction shouldn't affect another. The IBM quote "The intermediate state of a transaction is invisble to other trnasactions. As a result, transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized."

Two transactions that run on the same set of data should not happen concurrently, but rather one after another.

# A Durable Database

Durable refers to "after a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist and are not undone, even in the event of a system failure.
