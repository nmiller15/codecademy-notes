# TDD Feature-Level Tests

## Feature Test Toolbelt

### Chai

- This is a testing library that extends the types of assertions that it is possible to make.
- Chai can be paired with any JAvaSCript testing framework.

### Headless Browsers

- Allowing us to mimic user interaction and evaluate results without rendering a window.

### WebdriverIO

- Methods that allow interaction with user-facing elements

## Feature Tests

- The first feature test that we want to check is the application's *empty state*.
- We want to ensure that when no content is available, that nothing is displayed.

```javascript
describe('Poetry web app', () => {
  describe('user isits root'. () => {
    it('starts as a blank page', () => {
      // using browser.url() we can navigate Phantom to a url, in this case
      browser.url('/');
    })
  })
})
```

## Assert

- To validate that we get expected behavior, use Chai's `assert.equal` method:

```javascript
assert.equal(browser.getText('#poems'), '');
```

- The `.getText()` method comes from WebdriverIO
- Here's a fully fleshed out test:

```javascript
describe('Poetry web app', () => {
  describe('user isits root'. () => {
    it('starts as a blank page', () => {
      browser.url('/');

      assert.equal(browser.getText('#poems'), '');
    })
  })
})
```

## Passing

Once we get the error message, then we can move to the next step in our development process.

If you're using strict TDD, then you only write enough code to make the test pass. The error in the example we received above described that it couldn't find an HTML element with the given id so:

```html
<section id="poems"></section>
```

## Second Feature Test: Setup

After that we want to add another test

```javascript
describe('demo poetry web app', () => { 
    it('saves the user poem and title', () => {
      const title = 'Words Birth Worlds';
      const poem = 'Our words are marvelous weapons with which we could behead the sun';
    });
  });
```

## Second Feature Test: Exercise

We have to then exercise the code, run it through the function or feature that we are testing.

We can use the `.setValue()`  method on `browser` to mimic a user entering a title or poem.

```javascript
describe('demo poetry web app', () => { 
    it('saves the user poem and title', () => {
      // Setup
      const title = 'Words Birth Worlds';
      const poem = 'Our words are marvelous weapons with which we could behead the sun';
     // Exercise
      browser.url('/');
      browser.setValue('input[id=title]', title);
      browser.setValue('textarea[id=poem]', poem);
      browser.click('input[type=submit]');
    });
  });
```

## Second Feature Test: Verify

Now we compare the actual results of the exercise phase to the expected outcome in the "verify" phase.

We can use the `.getText()` on the `browser` and the `.include` method to check if the poem has been submitted

```javascript
const {assert} = require('chai');

describe('User visits root', () => {

  describe('demo poetry web app', () => { 
    it('saves the user poem and title', () => {
      // Setup
      const title = 'Words Birth Worlds';
      const poem = 'Our words are marvelous weapons with which we could behead the sun;
     // Exercise
      browser.url('/');
      browser.setValue('input[id=title]', title);
      browser.setValue('textarea[id=poem]', poem);
      browser.click('input[type=submit]');
      // Verify
      assert.include(browser.getText('#poems'), title);
      assert.include(browser.getText('#poems'), poem);
    });
  });
});
```

## Stuck in the Red

Once we implement the minimal code to mitigate the testing error that we are receiving we reevaluate.

In the above example, if we add an input element with an id=title and a textarea with an id=poem, then we will still have a failing test, but the error will now be an assertion error.

Since we are adding the content with our test, we are stuck. We cannot just add the content to the HTML elements since this is not actually testing our functionality. We must move down a layer at this point. Which will be discussed in the next document.
