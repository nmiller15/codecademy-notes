# Server Testing Patterns

## Introduction

You will have to make decisions between feature testing and server testing, a question that you can ask to help make this decision is:

"Is it worth trading a slow feature test for a faster server test that doesn't test the UI?"

Testing needs to be three things: reliable, complete and fast.

Server tests will often provide feedback in terms of HTTP domain concepts like status codes headers or response body content rather than the expected behavior model used by feature tests.

## Status Codes

Verifying status codes of responses is the most basic level of confidence that we can have to ensure the server is functioning.

`assert.equal(response.status, 200);`

## Response Content

We can organize response oriented tests into two categories:

   - expected use cases of the application: "Happy Path"
   - unexpected or invalid use of the app: "Sad Path"

## Refactoring: Route Parameters

If you notice repeated code that you want to refactor into route parameters, you can create a passing test for the parameters that you are refactoring and then have the confidence that your code still works after the refactor because the test will catch you by turning red!

## Refactoring: Handlebars

Handlebars is a templating library that separates the HTML view from the JavaSCript controller.

We place a handlebars templates in a folder `/views` and then we use file extension `.handlebars`

Now in the controller:

```javascript
const param = 'Foo';
res.render('templateName', {param});
```

And in the template:

```html
<h1>{{ param }}</h1>

<!-- Will render 
  <h1>Foo</h1>
-->
```

## API Errors

It is important that our application can handle incorrect or invalid responses like:

- invalid passwords
- form field errors
- nonexistent resources

It is much less resource intensive to run unexpected behavior testing on the back end, since there are many more possible invalid use cases than valid ones. Doing the testing on the back end keeps us from having to render the browser and speeds up the testing process.
