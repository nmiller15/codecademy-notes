# Server Testing Stack

## Introduction

When the testing with the front end fails in a way that cannot be resolved in the front-end, we move into server testing, where we can test things like API responses, or other server responses that our application relies on.

## Testing Framework: Chai

Chai is a library available to us to improve the readability of our code on the backend as well.

## Testing HTML Responses

jsdom will allow us to check the HTML responses in dynamic population situations. It allows us to select elements of the DOM and check relationships and content.

## SuperTest

This is a library designed to test server responses and integrates with Mocha and Chai. To make a get request with super test:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');

const getResponse = await request(app)
                          .get('/');
                          .send();

const postReponse = await request(app)
                        .post('/messages')
                        .type('form')
                        .send({author, message});
```

## Summary

- *Chai* - a library for extending the built in Node assertion library
- *jsdom* - a library for interacting and testing the DOM returned by the server (this functionality is encapsulated in our `parseTextFromHTML` helper function).
- *async / await* - a pattern for making asynchronous code more readable
- *SuperTest* - a library for making Node server requests and testing their responses
