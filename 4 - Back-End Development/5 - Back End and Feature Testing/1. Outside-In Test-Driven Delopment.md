# Outside-In Test-Driven Development

- Outside-in TDD takes the red, green, refactor logic from TDD and provides a framework for how to build a full-stack application. As it sounds, you will start from the outside, the UI or view layer, and then work your way deeper into the application until you reach the database layer as you TDD.
- If a test pushes you to a lower level, restart you red, green refactor by writing a new test.
- Once tests are written, it can be a good idea to delete some tests that are unneeded. Since you're testing at different layers, it is likely that your tests are covering the same functionality. You want to remove tests that will save the test suite on time to run, while not decreasing your confidence in the functionality of the code.
