- Pull Requests are a process of merging that happens on GitHub.
- When you create a pull request, your code is the source branch and the destination can be any of the branches in the remote
- Pull Requests offer a place for team members to review code, and then accept or reject the changes.
- Pull Requests are saved on projects so that you can review the history of code changes.

#### Pull Request Structure — What, Why, and How?

- The title should be a clear and consise description of the change made, similar to a commit message.
- If you ensure that your commit messages and comments in the code are consistent and clear you can save yourself some time in the explaining process.
- Keep Pull Requests Small and Fast! Split features into smaller parts so that review time can be speedier.
- Small pull requests also lead to less potential for wasted work and merge conflicts

### How To Use Git Rebase

- Rebase is an alternative to merge that allows us to move the base of a branch onto a different position.

- If we want to bring the quick_fix changes into the new_feature branch, we could do a merge, but then the commit history would be hard to follow and kind of messy. Rebase allows us to move the base of the new_feature branch, picking up the changes from the main branch

- This elminates the extra merge commits that would be required by `git merge`
- After rebase the commit history is linear rather than parallel
- We shouldn't always use rebase, merges are right certain situations.
   - Git merge preserves history, rebase rewrites history

- As a general rule, **merge** is good when you are adding a branch *back*, and **rebase** is good when you need to apply changes from the main *out* to a branch.
- Rebase is destructive and generally should not be used once something has been pushed since it can be hard to keep up with how things have changed.
- Best case for a rebase:
   - I am working on a feature locally. I have cloned a repo and branched it on my system.
   - Another developer noticed a bug in the release that I cloned and he or she fixed it, it has been pulled, reviewed and put into production.
   - At this point, I want my clone to have that change as well, so I will rebase my clone at the current production release, which is now updated from the one that I had downloaded earlier

### Using a .gitignore File in Your GitHub Repository

- .gitignore is a plain text file that tells Git to intentionally ignore changes in certain files
- Some common types of files that we ignore in git
   - configuraiton files with API or sercret keys such as .env
   - compiled binary files or production directories such as build or dist
   - log files
   - dependencies downloaded from a package manager such as node_modeules
   - system files such as thumbs.db on Windows or .DS_Store on macOS
- We add all of the files that we want git to ignore inot our .gitignore file as a line, by name
- The .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of the repository
- File names in the .gitignore file can be written relative to the location of .gitignore
- To see .gitignore you will have to `ls -a` to see it
- We can also use .gitignore to ignore patterns
   - `*` wildcard will match 0 or more characters except for /
      - `*.html` would ignore all html files
      - `example*` would ignore any file that starts with the string "example”
   - You can also use a ! to negate

```other
index*
!public/index.css
```

- This file will allow you to put in any RegEx to ignore files - matching files will be ignored.
- There are typically templates that will be accurate for what you need.
