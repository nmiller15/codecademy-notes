# Git Teamwork

Remotes - A shared Git repository that allows multiple collaborators to work on the same Git project from different locations.

### git clone

- `git clone remote_location clone_name` - make your own local copy of a repository
   - `remote_location` can be a web address or filepath
   - `clone_name` is the name of the clone directory

### git remote-v

- When you clone a remote, Git will name the remote `origin`
- You can see all of the project remotes with this command:
- `git remote -v`
- The output will look like this:

```other
origin  /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum/science-quizzes (fetch)
origin  /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum/science-quizzes (push)
```

### git fetch

- `git fetch` check to see if there have been any changes to the remote that you are working on
- Does not merge, creates a remote branch

### git merge

- When you fetch changes, the commits that you didn't make are on a branch called `origin/main` but your local `main` branch hasn't been updated yet
- So `git merge origin/main`

### Git Workflow

1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review. `git push`

Steps 1 and 4 protect us against merge conflicts.

### git push

- `git push origin <your_branch_name>` - This will push your branch to the remote, allowing the owner to review thte branch and merge it with the master branch (the <> are not included)
