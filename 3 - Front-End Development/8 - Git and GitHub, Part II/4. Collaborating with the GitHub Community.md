# Collaborating with the GitHub Community

### What is the GitHub Community?

- GitHub is much more than just a place to host source control, though it does that well.
- Your GitHub profile is something that will be viewed by potential employers, and your profile can demonstrate that your skills are what your resume says they are.
- Having several good projects that are well documented with a good README can show people that you are able to communicate your project to other developers.
- GitHub is also the place where people and companies will host open source software, software that anyone can clone and modify. Working on these projects is a good idea because you will be contributing to software used by major companies.

### Forking a Repository

- Click "Fork" and then show where you'd like to fork the repo
- Then you can download the project like any other GitHub project
- Set the Upstream so you can still get updates
   - Get the https key
   - git remote add upstream <https key>
   - Upstream is set to parent repo
   - git fetch upstream - updates your repo
