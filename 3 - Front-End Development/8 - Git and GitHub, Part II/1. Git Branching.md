# Git Branching

- GitHub has recently updated the terminology of the `master` branch to the `main` branch. > If you see master here, that refers to main

### git branch

- Branching allows you to create a clone of a file to test something. No changes will be made to the `main` branch until a `merge` is completed
- `git branch` will help you find out which branch you are on
- If there are multiple branches, then the asterick will show you which branch youâ€™re on

### branching overview

- In this diagram, the circles are commits and this is a diagram of the commit history
- *New Branch* is a different *version* of the project. It includes the previous commits from the main branch all the way to the new branch.

### git branch 2

- `git branch new_branch` - Create a new branch

### git checkout

- `git checkout branch_name` - switch to a new branch

### commit on a new branch

- commit as normal

### git merge

- `git merge branch_name` - merges the argued branch name with the branch that you are on
- To merge with the `main` branch, switch to the `main` branch and then name the branch you want to merge

### merge conflict

- There are a lot of scenerios that can cause a merge conflict, but the essence of it is that git has a discrepancy that it doesn't know how to solve, and it wants you to do it.
   - There was a commit made on main and not on the branch
   - The commit on main altered the same text that the branch did

### delete branch

- After a branch has been merged, the branch can be deleted.
- `git branch -d branch_name` deletes branch
