# Introduction to Web APIs

### What are APIs?

- *Application Programming Interfaces* (or APIs) are software tools that make it easier for developers to interact with another application to use some of that appolications functionality.

### Types of APIs

- *Browser APIs* are specific to writing code related to browsers and give developers access to information that the browser can also access.

- *Third-party APIs* are apps that provide some type of functionality or information from a third-party, usually a company.

### Requesting Information from a Third-party API

- We have rules and requirements from developers including structure and protocol for how APIs can be interacted with.
- Often you will have to create an account and receive an API key which will allow you access to functionality

#### Making Requests

- Each API will provide documetation that will specify how to make requests of the software.

#### Response Data

- Many APIs format their response data using *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)* which looks like a JavaScript object.
- An example of JSON:

```javascript
{
  "temperature" : {
    "celcius" : 25,
  },
  "city": "chicago",
}
```

- The consumtion of the data is up to you!
