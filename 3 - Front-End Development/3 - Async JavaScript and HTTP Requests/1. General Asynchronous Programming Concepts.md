# General Asynchronous Programming Concepts

### What is Synchronous Code?

- Synchronous code is code that executes in sequential order starting at the top and going to the bottom.
- This is also known as *blocking* or *blocking code*
- Each line of code cannot execute until the previous line finishes.

### What is Asynchronous Codee?

- Asynchronous code can execute at the same time as other code
- This makes programs faster or more efficent since they donâ€™t have to wait
- Considered *non-blocking*

### Asynchronous Code Under the Hood

- For code or tasks to run asynchronously they must do this on a *thread*.
- The more *threads* available to the program, the more tasks can be completed concurrently.
- In computers a lot of times this is done with a multi-core CPU, or with some other technology

### Asynchronous Code in Web Development

- If everything was synchronous, that means that during load times, users wont be able to interact with some parts of an application. If it takes too long people will probably just go to a different site.
- Async allows us to run more efficently and cut load times.
