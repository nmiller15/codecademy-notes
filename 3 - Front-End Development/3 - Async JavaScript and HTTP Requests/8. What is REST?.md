# What is REST?

### REpresentational State Transfers

- This is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web
- Rest-compliant or RESTful systems:
   - are stateless
   - separate the concerns of the client and server

#### Separation of Client and Server

- In this style the client and server can be implemented separately
- Data storage, or server code can be updated without affecting the client
- The client can change their code without affecting the server.
- This improves scalability and flexibility of he interface across platforms

#### Statelessness

- Being stateless means that the server does not need to know anything about the state of the client and vice versa
- Both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages.
- Statlessness is enforced through use of *resources* instead of *commands*

### Communication between Client and SErver

- Below are REST requirements:

#### Making Requests

- A client must make a request to retrieve or modify data on the server
- The skeleton of a request:
   + **an HTTP verb, which defines the kind of operation**
      - GET - retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources
      - POST - create a new resource
      - PUT - update a specific resource (by id)
      - DELETE - remove a specific resource by id
      - More info here ⇒ [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud)
   + **a *header*, whcih allows the client to pass along information about the request**
      - This is where the client tells the server what type of information it is able to receive
      - This is called the `Accept` field
      - The options for types of content are MIME Types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
      - These consist of **types** and **subtypes**. `type/subtype`
         - `text/html` `text/css` `text/plain` `image/png` `image/jpeg` `audio/wav` `video/mp4` `application/json` `application/pdf`

```other
GET /articles/23
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml
```

      - A sample GET request header
   + a path to a resource
      - Paths should be descriptive and human-readable. Convention is to have the first part of a path be the plural form of the type of resource that the path leads to
      - `fashionbotique.com/customers/223/orders/12`
         - It is clear where we are going. *Hierarchical* and *descriptive*
         - The numbers reference `id` ‘s
   - an optional message body containing data

### Sending Responses

#### Content Types

- The server must also include a MIME type of the data that it is responding to the client with.
- The MIME type returned should be one of the content-types that the client specified in the accept field of the request

#### Response Codes

| Status code                 | Meaning                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200 (OK)                    | This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests.                                         |
| 201 (CREATED)               | Standard response for HTTP request that creates items                                               |
| 204 (NO CONTENT)            | Standard response for a successful HTTP request where nothing is being returned.                    |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST)           | Request not processed due to bad syntax, excessive size, or another client-side error               |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN)             | Client does not have permission to access this resource                                             |
| 404 (NOT FOUND)             | The resource could not be found at this time. It is possible it was deleted, or does not exist yet. |
| 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) | The generic answer for an unexpected failure if there is no more specific information available.    |

- Expected success codes for each HTTP verb
   - GET - 200
   - POST - 201
   - PUT - 200
   - DELETE - 204
