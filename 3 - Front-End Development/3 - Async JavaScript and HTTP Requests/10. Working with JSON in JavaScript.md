# Working with JSON in JavaScript

- Note the differences in the object notation.
   - All strings, including keys, must be surrounded in double quotes while this is optional in JavaScript
   - JavaScript accepts strings that are single or double-quoted, even though some style guides will prefer one or the other. In JavaScript they must be double.

### Reading a JSON String

- Information coming back from a web request will be in the form of a string, and that string might be in a file with a `.json` extension.
- Each language has its own mechanism to handle the conversion of the string to usable data.
- JavaScript has a built-in JSON class with a method called `.parse()` that takes a JSON strong and returns a JavaScript object

```javascript
const jsonData = '{ "book": { "name": "JSON Primer", "price": 29.99, "inStock": true, "rating": null } }'

const jsObject = JSON.parse(jsonData);

console.log(jsObject);

/* Console output
{
  book: { name: 'JSON Primer', price: 29.99, inStock: true, rating: null}
}
*/
```

### Writing a JSON String

- The built in JSON method `.stringify()` will transform our JavaScript objects into JSON strings.

```javascript
const jsObject = {
  book: 'JSON Primer', 
  price: 29.99, 
  inStock: true, 
  rating: null
};
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(jsObject);
console.log(jsonData);
/* Console output
{ "book": "JSON Primer", "price": 29.99, "inStock": true, "rating": null }
*/
```
