# Concurrency Model and Event Loop in JavaScript

### Why do we need an event loop?

- JavaScript is *single-threaded* meaning that two statements can't be executed simultaneously.
- Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, we use asynchronous JavaScript to use the event loop, enabling concurrency.

### Concurrency in JavaScript

- Concurrency in programming is two or more procedures executed at the same time on the same shared resources.
- JavaScript doesn’t have “true” concurrency, but we can emulate it with the event loop.

### What Is the Event Loop?

- The event loop is a system for managing code execution.
- Essentially it will set the order of code execution when asynchronous actions are involved.

### Understand the Componenets of the Event Loop

The event loop has the following parts

- Memory Heap
- Call Stack
- Event Queue
- Event Loop
- Node or Web APIs

#### The Heap

- A block of memory where we store objects in an unordered manner.
- Variables and objects that are being used are stored in the heap.

#### The Call Stack

- The *stack* or *call stack*, tracks what function is currently being run in your code.
- When you call a function
- A frame is added to the stack
- Frames connect that function’s arguments and local variables from the heap.
- Frames enter the stack LIFO

```javascript
function foo() {
  return function bar() {
    return function baz() {
      return 'I love CodeCademy'
    }
  }
}
console.log(foo()()());
```

- The function executing at any given point is at the top of the stack.
- In this example, they will all be added to the stack until the innermost is executed.
- When a function finished executing its frame is removed from the stack.

here’s a table of how the stack will change step by step when the console.log() statement is called:

|          |                       |                       |                       | baz()                 |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
|          |                       |                       | bar()                 | bar()                 |
|          |                       | foo()                 | foo()                 | foo()                 |
|          | console.log(function) | console.log(function) | console.log(function) | console.log(function) |
| global() | global()              | global()              | global()              | global()              |

- `global()` at the bottom is the *global execution context* it contains the environment's variable and lexical environment. Every other frame contains that functions execution context including its lexical and variable environment
- The call stack is tracking the current execution context
- Once a function is run to completion it pops off the call stack. The memory, or frame is cleared

#### The Event Queue

- The event queue is a list of messages corresponding to functions that are waiting to be processed.
- No code is executed in the queue
- Messages enter the queue in a FIFO order

#### The Event Queue in Context

- When the stack is empty, messages that are waiting in the queue can be added one at a time to the stack for execution.
   1. First the event loop will poll the stack to see if its empty.
   2. It will add the first waiting message
   3. It will repeat steps 1 and 2 undtil the stack has cleared.

### The Event Loop in Action

```javascript
console.log("This is the first line of code in app.js.");

function usingsetTimeout() {
  console.log("I'm going to be queued in the Event Loop.");
}
setTimeout(usingsetTimeout, 3000);

console.log("This is the last line of code in app.js.");
```

1. `console.log("This is the first line of code in app.js.");` is added to the stack, executes, then pops off the stack.
2. `setTimeout()` is added to the stack.
3. `setTimeout()`'s callback is passed to be executed by a web API. The time will run for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds elapse, the callback function, `usingsetTimeout()` is pushed to the Event Queue.
4. The Event Loop, meanwhile, will check periodically if the stack is cleared to handle any messages in the Event Queue.
5. `console.log(“This is the last line of code in app.js.”);` is added to the stack, executes, then pops off the stack.
6. The stack is now empty, so the event lop pushes `usingsetTimeout` onto the stack.
7. `console.log(“I'm going to be queued in the Event Loop.”);` is added to the stack, executes, gets popped.
8. `usingsetTimeout` pops off the stack.

### Summary

> The event loop can be summarized as: when code is executed, it is handled by the heap and call stack, which interact with Node and Web APIs. Those APIs enable concurrency and pass asynchronous messages back to the stack via an event queue. The event queue’s interaction with the call stack is managed by an event loop. All together, those parts maintain the order of code execution when we run asynchronous functions.
