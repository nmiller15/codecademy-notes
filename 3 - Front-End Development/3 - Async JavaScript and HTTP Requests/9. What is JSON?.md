# What is JSON?

- JSON is a popular, language-independent, standard format for strogin and exchanging data
- JSON is the de facto standard for facilitating the storing and sending of data between all programming languages.

### Common Uses of JSON

- Facilitate data transfer in web applications between an client and a server
   - Client ⇒ HTML Form data ⇒ JavaScript Object ⇒ JSON object ⇒ Remote web server

### JSON Syntax

- Its appearance is similar to JavaScript objects
- Sample JSON object

```javascript
{
  "student": {
    "name": "Rumaisa Mahoney", 
    "age": 30,
    "fullTime": true,
    "languages": ["JavaSCript", "HTML", "CSS"],
    "GPA": 3.9,
    "favoriteSubject": null
  }
}
```

- Trailing commas, or commas after the last key-value pair, are not allowed here even though they are allowed in JavaScript
- Any data that JSON does not recognize can be stored as a string and converted to a language-specific data structure.
   - ISO 8601 date format
