# HTTP Requests

- When a client searches for a website address, the client sends a HTTP *GET* requests. It is a retrieveal request.
- Browsers will send this information as text to the server, it may look like this

```other
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.codecademy.com
```

- This identifies the type of request `/` and the protocol `HTTP/1.1` (which is an update from 1.0 which made browsers reestablish connection for every resource)
- If the server can locate the requested path, it may respond like this:

```other
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
```

- After the header will be the requested content, the information required to render the webpage
- `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` is confirmation that the server understands the protocol the clinet wants to communicate with, and an HTTP status code that says the resource was found on the server.
- the second line shows the type of content that is incoming
- If the server canâ€™t findit

```other
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
```

#### What is HTTPS?

- It is short for HTTP Secure, it allows for the encryption of the data going back and forth between the server.
- It is up to the businesses that maintiain the servers to set up HTTPS
- For HTTPS to be supported, the business must apply for a certificate from a Certificate Authority.
