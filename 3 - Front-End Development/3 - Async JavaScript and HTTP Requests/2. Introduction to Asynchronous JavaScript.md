# Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript

### Asynchronous Callbacks

- A callback function that executes after a specific condition is met and runs concurrently to any other code currently running

```javascript
easterEgg.addEventListener('click', () => {
  ...
})
```

- `addEventListener()` is an asynchronous callback because it doesn't execute until easterEgg is clicked

### setTimeout

- A built-in function that performs tasts asynchronously.
- Tell JavaScript to wait a minimum amount of time before executing the callback function.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Delay the printing of this string, please.');
}, 1000);
```

- 2 arguments, a function and a number to specify how long to wait (milliseconds)
- Will wait for specifiied time and then

### setInterval

- Takes same arguments as setTimeout, but specifies how often a callback function should execute.

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  alert('Are you paying attention???')
}, 300000);
```

- This would make a message pop up every 5 minutes - don't do this
