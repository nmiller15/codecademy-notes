# Mocking in Tests

### What is Mocking?

- Mocking is creating a fake version of an external service for testing purposes, particularly in unit and integration tests.
- If it relies on an API or database, we will likely mock data.
- It is helpful to mock in unit testing, to make sure that the module itself works as intended. But, we would not want to mock in integration testing, because we are testing the functionality of the two modules together.
   - This applies to internal testing, not external, external services will be mocked.
