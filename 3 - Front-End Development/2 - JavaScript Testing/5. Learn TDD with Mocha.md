# Learn TDD with Mocha

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

- Red and green refers to the color of the text that our test framework produces in the terminal while running the tests in our suite.

- The idea is to write only enough implementation code to make the test pass.
- Think about all of the code that was written, test and implementation and refactor it. Refactor the test - red, refactor the implementaiton - green, and revisit again until you have fast and working code!

### Getting Into The Red I

- In red, green refactor we
   1. Write code that fails
   2. Write implementation code that makes the test pass
   3. Consider refactoring the code

### Red To Green I

- Write the minimum possible code to get rid of the error
- Run the test again at the next smallest change to see if the error changes and then fix that error.
- At some point you will likely make a change that will technically solve the problem, but may not be entirely right - thatâ€™s okay, just get the test to pass. We will handle refactoring in the next phase

### Refactor I

- Now that we have a green, we can actually begin building. We do this because we now have confidence that the test will catch us if we make a mistake.
- Start refactoring at the test level:
   - four phases?
   - Use variables with clear names to make a test more expressive
      - Everything that can have a descriptive name should
   - Use comments to mark the sections of the code

### Getting into the Red II

- You will then add new tests that check additional functionality of the code. So if you just used a return phrase in the first phase, now you will have to create code that will return each.
- Continue adding tests and going through the cycle until you are confident in the functionality

### Refactor II

- Is there anything:
   - unnecessary
   - reduntant
   - could be done more clearly
   - could be more efficient

### Edge Case

- An *edge case* is a problem of situation that occurs only at an extreme (max or min) operating parameter. These are special cases to account for.
