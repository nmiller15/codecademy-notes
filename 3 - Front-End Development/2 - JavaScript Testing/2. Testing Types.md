# Testing Types

### Unit Tests

- Testing the smallest possible unit of testable code, like a function.
- Any data that the code relies on should be supplied with ‘dummy’ code.

### Integration Tests

- how the units of a program work togther.
- If you’re testing integrations with external services, only the *handling* of the incoming data is tested while the data itself is still mocked.

### End to End Tests

- Automation of user flow to test an application in the way that a user would experience it.
- It tests just about everything from start to finish.

### How do these tests relate?

- The order above represents an inrease in resource intensity (time, computation, money)
- The order above represents an increase in the scope of testing.
- A typical testing workflow:
   1. Make code changes
   2. Make a pull request
   3. The code change has tests run against it (unit, integration, sometimes e2e)
   4. If there are any failures then the dev will work on fixes in their local dev environment.
   5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all tests pass.
   6. The pull request is allowed to be merged.
