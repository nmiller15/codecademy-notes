### What is Code Coverage?

- Code coverage is the metric that measure the amount of code that has been executed by our testing.
- Coverage criteria is different by industry and application
- Things to think about:
   - *Function coverage*: Has each function been called?
   - *Statement coverage:* Has each statement been executed?
   - *Path coverage*: Has ever edge in the control-flow graph been executed?
   - *Condition coverage:* Has each boolean sub-expression evaluated to be both true and false?
- 100% coverage doesn’t mean bug-free code, we still have to be aware of edge cases. You will probably have to run pieces of code multiple times to test for everything
- Test coverage measure the percentage of the required features/specs that are tested, as opposed  to the percentage of lines executed.
   - These would be defined by a client or product designer
- Though it’s not a guarantee, testing in this way will help us identify *more* problems *sooner*.
