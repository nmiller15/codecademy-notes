# Write Good Tests with Mocha

## Automate and Organize Tests

### Introduction

- A *test framework* is something that developers use to automate their testing
[Mocha - the fun, simple, flexible JavaScript test framework](https://mochajs.org/)

### Install Mocha

- *npm* is a Node tool that allows you to download packages from the web, and manage them in a JavaScript porject
- *Mocha* is one of the packages and it is used to test other JavaSCript code

```other
$ npm init
```

- Creates a new file: ‘package.json’ that can be used to manage packages for the project
- After running this commany you will be prompted to enter info about the project, you can skip fields

```other
$ npm install mocha -D
```

- Installs packages
- `-D` siginifies that this is a development dependency. It will appear under `devDependencies` in package.json
   - That means the package is only included in the development mode not in the production bundle
- After insalling, the packages go to a folder called node_modules

```other
project
|_ node_modules
|___ .bin
|___ mocha
|___ ...
|_ package.json
```

- Now that Mocha is installed as a dependency we can run it two ways
```other
$./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

   - Or add a script to package.json
      - in the `scripts` object in package.json, set the value of `"test"` to `mocha`

```other
"scripts": {
  "test": "mocha"
}
```

   - and that allow us to

```other
$ npm test
```

### describe and it blocks

- `describe` is used to group tests, and `it` is used to define tests
- Structure the test suite similarly to how you will implement your code
- Provide informative messages using human-readable strings.
- Example: If you were testing a `Math` object with the method `.max` you could use the following test code:

```javascript
describe('Math', () => {
  describe('.max', () => {
    it('returns the argument with the highest value', () => {
    // Your test goes here
  });
    it('returns -Infinity when no arguments are provided', () => {
      // Your test goes here
    });
  });
});
```

- Both `describe` and `it` accept two parameters: a descriptive string and a callback function.
- These are flexible, but generally used as above: nest `describe` blocks to resemble the structure of your implementation code and write individual tests in `it` blocks.
   - This creates an *isolated, maintainable,* and *expressive* test suite.

### assert

- In programming, a test compares an expected outcome to an actual outcome.
- `assert.ok()` is a Node.js method that allows us to compare values and throw erros as needed only using one function call.
- The functions are small and readable, which helps us to make an *expressive* test suite, whatever that means
- You can import assert at the top of our files with:

```javascript
cost assert = require('assert');
```

- You call `assert` functions like this:

```javascript
assert.ok(a === 3);
```

- If the expression evaluates to `true` then no error is thrown.
- If the expression evaluates to `false` an `AssertionError` is thrown
   - The error communicates to Mocha a test has failed
   - Mocha logs the error to the console

### Setup, Exercise, and Verify

- We should set up tests into three well defined areas - *setup, exercise, and verify* phases
   - *Setup -* create objects, variables, and set conditions that you test depends on
   - *Exercise* - execute the functionalty you are testing
   - *Verify* - check your expectations against the result of the exercise phase. You can sue the `assert` library here
- Clear separation makes code more readable
- An example:

```javascript
describe('.pop', () => {
  it('returns the last element in the array [3phase]', () => {
    // Setup
    const knightString = 'knight';
    const jediPath = ['padawan', knightString];

    // Exercise
    const popped = jediPath.pop();

    // Verify
    assert.ok(popped === knightString);
  })
})
```

### Teardown

- In most situations, we will need to write many tests of a feature that should be executed in succession.
- Multiple tests can introduce issues if the tests are making changes to the testing environment:
   - altering files and directory structure
   - changing read and write permissions on a file
   - editing records in a database
- At the end of our tests we can prevent any changes by addign a *teardown* step when makes our tests isolated by resetting the environment before the next test
- Isolated tests are good because:
   - They don’t affect other tests
   - They can be run in any order
- If there are no conditions to reset, no teardown is needed

### Hooks

- Setup and teardown are often similar if not identical between tests. The Mocha framework provides function that enable us to reduce repetition and simplify the scope of each test.
- These function, called *hooks*, are:
   - beforeEach(callback) - callback is run before each test
   - afterEach(callback) - callback is run after each test
   - before(callback) - callback is run before the first test
   - after(callback) - callback is run after the last test
- Each hook accepts a callback that can be executed throughout the test

```javascript
describe('messing aroun with hooks', () => {

  let testValue; // Variable used by both tests

  beforeEach(() => {
    testValue = 5;
  });

  it('should add' () -> {
    // testValue = 5     << Moved to beforeEach()
    testValue = testValue + 5;
    assert.equal(testValue, 10);
  });

  it('should multiply' () => {
    // testValue = 5     << Moved to beforeEach()
    testValue = testValue * 5;
    assert.equal(testValue, 25);
  });
});
```

- Hooks are not the *only* way to do setup and teardown, and you will occasionally have to perform unique setup and teardown.

## Write Expressive Tests

### Introduction

- An expressive test is easy to read and descriptive, making it useful as a form of documentation for your implementation code.
- You can make a test expressive by clarifying its *verify* phrase

### assert.ok

- The functions in the `assert` library compare values and throw erros as needed using one function call

### assert.equal

- Instead of evaluating expressions inside of `.ok()` we can use provided methods like `.equal()`

```javascript
assert.ok(landAnimals[2] == waterAnimals[2]);
assert.equal(landAnimals[2], waterAnimals[2]);
```

- These are the same, but the second line is more expressive, a reader only needs to read the word equal to understand.

### assert.strictEqual

```javascript
const a = 3; 
const b = '3';

assert.ok(a == b); // Doesn't throw an error, loose equality - type conversion
assert.equal(a, b);

assert.ok(a === b); // Throws error, strict equality - types must match
assert.strictEqual(a, b);
```

### assert.deepEqual

- You cannot use either of the above equality functions with distinct **objects**. They are not considered equal in JavaScript.
- If you need to compare value within two objects, you can use `assert.deepEqual()`
- You can also manually confirm but performing a loose equality expression on each of the object.parameters
- This is also all true for **arrays**

### Other assert methods

All methods can be found in the Node.js documentation below

[](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)

There’s a lot of ways to make these expressions, so you want to be thoughtful about how you’re expressing them to a *human!*
