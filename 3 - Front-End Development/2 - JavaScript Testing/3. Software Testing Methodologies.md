# Software Testing Methodologies

### What is a software testing methodology?

- *testing methodologies* are specific strategies for testing all of the pieces of your software to make sure it behaves as expected.

### Different types of methodologies

- Some testing methodologies prioritize **writing test cases before** writing the code those cases validate:
   - Test-driven development (TDD)
   - Behavior-driven Development (BDD)
   - Specification by Example (SBE)
   - Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD)

### Test-driven development

- Takes a test-first approach
- Test cases start with the definition of their purpose or use case
- TDD tests look at the *componenets* of code, functions and classes and such
- Benefits:
   - accelerated software development
   - short dev cycles
   - devs better understand the requirements of the code before writing
   - code that is never executed isn’t added to the codebase
   - scope of development is reduced
   - code is written with testability in mind

### Behavior-driven development

- Very similiar to TDD but the unit of testing is larger. ⇒ The "feature"
- Does the feature work or not?
