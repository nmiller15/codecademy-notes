# Redux Toolkit

- The Redux toolkit was made by the creators of Redux to handle some of the problems of verbosity that many developers encounter when using Redux.
- This section focuses on two essential methods that are added by Redux - `createSlice()` and `configureStore()`

- To install the redux toolkit locally, run this command to install the toolkit into your application

```other
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

### "Slices" of State

- Check the section above for all of the boilerplate that we had to make a Slice in Redux.
- Redux Toolkit introduces `createSlice()`

### Refactoring with createSlice()

- `createSlice()` takes one parameter, a configuration object
   - A configuration object has:
      - `name` - string idetifier of the slice
      - `initialState` - an initial state value for the reducer
      - `reducers` - an object where each key represents and action `type` a string identifier for the action, associated with the method or “case reducer”

```javascript
/* todosSlice.js */
// Configuration object for createSlice
const options = {
  name: 'todos', // Name of slice
  initialState: [], // Initial state
  reducers: {
    // Reducer for "addTodo" action
    addTodo: (state, action) => {
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.payload.id,
          text: action.payload.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    },
    // Reducer for "toggleTodo" action
    toggleTodo: (state, action) => {
      return state.map(todo => (todo.id === action.payload.id 
                                ? {... todo, completed: !todo.completed} 
                                : todo))
    }
  }
}

const todosSlice = createSlice(options);
```

- This object, after passed to createSlice now has:
   - A name and initial state
   - Two reducers (addTodo and toggleTodo)
   - Action creators automatically generated for each reducer function defined in the reducers object

### Writing "Mutable" Code with Immer

- Because it is such a common mistake to mutate state within our reducers rather than allowing the store to do that, Redux uses a library called **Immer** to help us.
- This all happens under the hood, and Immer essentially just allows us to directly mutate and it will change our “mutating code” into a list of changes to make to state.
- Don’t have to do anything to take advantage of this, it is included in `createSlice()`
- Here are some common update patterns:

[](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/update-patterns)

### Returned Objects and Auto-Generated Actions

- When `createSlice()` is used it will return an object. Given the above example, this is the object that would be returned:

```javascript
/* Object returned by todosSlice */
{
 name: 'todos',
 reducer: (state, action) => newState,
 actions: {
   addTodo: (payload) => ({type: 'todos/addTodo', payload}),
   toggleTodo: (payload) => ({type: 'todos/toggleTodo', payload})
 },
 // case reducers field omitted
```

- `name` holds a string used as the prefix for generated action types
- `reducer` is the completed reducer function
- `actions` are auto-generated action creators
   - These actions take only one argument which becomes `action.payload`
   - `action.type` is formed by combining the slice's name with the case reducer functions name

```javascript
console.log(todosSlice.action.addTodo('walk dog'))
// {type: 'todos/addTodo', payload: 'walk dog'}
```

- All that's left is to export the actions to be used in the rest of the project. You could export the whole object, but it's best practice to export the named action creators to follow the "ducks" pattern
[](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#structure-files-as-feature-folders-or-ducks)

```javascript
export const { addTodo, toggleTodo } = todosSlice.actions
```

### Returned Objects and Reducers

- When using `createSlice()` the reducer that is returned is a comprehensive reducer function that represents the collection of case reducers ⇒ combining them into one.
- This is commonly called the “slice reducer”
- Instead of using `switch` / `case` imparitively in our code, `createSlice()` 's slice reducer in the returned object will do this automatically.
- So if we use the generated action creator `dispatch(addTodo(‘do the dishes’)` what happens is:
   - An object is created that looks like

```javascript
{
  type: 'todos/addTodo'
  payload: 'do the dishes'
}
```

   - This goes back to the “slice reducer” and sees if any of the case reducers have the same type, and executes the matching case
   - If there is no match, it will return state
- You still need to export the reducer after it is auto-generated

```javascript
export const { addTodo, toggleTodo } = todosSlice.actions;
export default todosSlice.reducer
```

### Converting the Store to Use `configureStore()`

- `configureStore()` wraps around the Redux library's `createStore()` method and the `combineReducers()` method, and handles most of the store set up for us automatically.
- `configureStore()` accepts one configuration object as a parameter that must have a `reducer` property that defines either a function to be used as the root reducer, or an object of slice reducers, which will be combined to create a root reducer.
- You can add many other properties to this object, but the reducer is the minimum

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import todosReducer from '.../'
import filtersReducer from '.../'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Define a top-level state field named 'todos', handled by 'todosReducer'
    todos: todosReducer,
    filters: filtersReducer
  }
})

export default store
```

- In this example, `configureStore()`
   - Combined our reducers into a root reducer
   - Creates a Redux store using that root reducer
   - Automatically adds middleware to check for common mistakes, like accidentally mutating the state
   - Sets up the Redux DevTools Extension connection.
      - The last two we would have had to do ourselves in the manual way.
