# Core Redux API

### What is the Redux API?

- The Redux API gives us the `createStore()` method with the following store methods
   - `store.getState()`
   - `store.dispatch(action)`
   - `store.subscribe(listener)`
[Core Concepts | Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)

### Create a Redux Store

- We can execute our reducer manually, but that is the job of the store. To manage the global state of our application and to execute our reducer function.
- Reduxâ€™s store is exported as an object called `store` and we can create an instance of this object with `createStore()` which takes a reducer function as an argument.

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux'

const initialState = 'on';
const lightSwitchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return state === 'on' ? 'off' : 'on';
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export const store = createStore(lightSwitchReducer);
```

### Dispatch Actions to the Store

- We can disbatch actions to the store by using the `store.dispatch()` method which takes an action as an argument

```javascript
const action = {type: 'actionDescriptor'};
store.dispatch(action);
```

- This will send the action object into the reducer function in the store and the state will be updated and returned.

```javascript
const initialState = 'on';
const lightSwitchReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'toggle':
      return state === 'on' ? 'off' : 'on';
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const store = createStore(lightSwitchReducer);

console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'on'

store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle' }); 
console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'off'

store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle' });
console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'on'
```

- `store.getState()` returns the current value of the store's state
- Under the hood, you can imagine that when you dispatch a an action, this is what is happening:

```javascript
// Dispatched action
store.dispatch({ type: 'toggle' });

// Call to reducer
lightSwitchReducer(store.getState(), { type: toggle });
```

### Action Creators

- So that we don't have to type out actions every time, Redux acommonly uses *action creators* which is simply a function that returns an action object with a type property. Typically they are called and passed directly into the `store.dispatch()` method

```javascript
const toggle = () => {
  return { type: "toggle" };
}

store.dispatch(toggle());
store.dispatch(toggle());
store.dispatch(toggle());
```

- This also has the added benefit of making our code more expressive and readable, provided the naming of our functions is good.

### Respond to State Changes

- In the `store` actions dispatched can be listened for and responded to using the `store.subscribe()` method, which takes a function argument often called a *listener*, that is executed in response to changes tot eh `store` 's state.

```javascript
const reactToChange = () => console.log('change detected!')
store.subscribe(reactToChange);
```

- Each time an action is dispatched to the `store` and a change to the state occurs, the subscribed listener, `reactToChange()` will be executed
- If we want to stap the listener from responding to changes to the `store` we can use the `unsubscribe` function that is returned by `store.subscribe()`

```javascript
// lightSwitchReducer(), toggle(), and store omitted...

const reactToChange = () => {
  console.log(`The light was switched ${store.getState()}!`);
}
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(reactToChange);

store.dispatch(toggle());
// reactToChange() is called, printing:
// 'The light was switched off!'

store.dispatch(toggle());
// reactToChange() is called, printing:
// 'The light was switched on!'

unsubscribe(); 
// reactToChange() is now unsubscribed

store.dispatch(toggle());
// no print statement!

console.log(store.getState()); // Prints 'off'
```

- You don't have to use `unsubscribe` at all, but it is useful to know that it is there. `store.subscribe()` does not function as a toggle however, it *returns* a function to unsubscribe. Calling `store.subscribe()` on the same function multiple times will cause there to be multiple executions of the listener when activted.

### Connect the Redux Store to a UI

- To use Redux connected with any UI library, you will have to
   - Create a Redux store
   - Render the initial state of the application
   - Subscribe to updates. Inside the subscription callback:
      - Get the current store state
      - Select the data needed by this piece of UI
      - Update the UI with the data
   - Respond to UI events by dispatching Redux actions.
- We will follow these steps in React, Angular, or jQuery.
- In React, we will plug the Redux store into the UI by using the `App` component and the `render` function in `index.js`
