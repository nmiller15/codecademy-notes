# Core Concepts in Redux

- Redux is a state management library that assists us in managing complex state in applications. It is built on Flux architecture, which is built on the principle of consolidating all shared information into a single object rather than scattering state across individual components.

### One-Way Data Flow

- In React, components are often responsible for rendering and re-rendering as well as managing state. Redux allows us to separate this concern a bit more.
- The One-Way Data Flow refers to the fact that even when a user alters, say, a form field - what is actually happening is that every change to the field
   1. Updates the state variable, and then...
   2. Updates the view for the user

### State

- State in redux can be defined in a variable

```javascript
const state = ['Take Five', 'Claire de Lune', 'Respect'];
```

### Actions

- Actions describe an event or an action that has occured and provide information about what needs to be updated in the application's state.
- Actions are how Redux manages and updates the state.
- In Redux, actions are represented as plain JS objects.

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'todos/addTodo',
  payload: 'Take selfies'
};
```

- `type` this describes the action
- `payload` - takes an object value, this example is for a to-do list app, so the payload contains the todo that is being passed
- When an action is generated and notifies other parts of the application, we say that it is *disbatched*.
- Here’s two more examples

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'todos/removeAll'
}

const action = {
  type: 'todos/removeTodo',
  payload: 'Pack snacks'
}
```

### Reducers

- A **reducer** or reducer function is a plain JavaScript function that defines how the current state and an action are used in combination to create the new state.

```javascript
const initialState = ['Print trail map', 'Pack snacks', 'Summit the mountain'];

const todoReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'todos/addTodo': {
      return [...state, action.payload];
    }
    case 'todos/removeAll': {
      return [];
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

- The `default` will return the initial state, this is to handle having no action provided
- The equal `=` sign in the parameter list will **supply a default value** for that parameter.
- The `...` is a **spread operator** expands the values located in the state array into the new array being returned

### Rules of Reducers

- The last exercise returns a new copy of the the state rather than directly editing it. This adheres to the Rules of Reducers
- Redux provides the following rules in their documentation
   1. The should only calculate the new state value based on the `state` and `action` arguments.
   2. They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must copy the existing state and make changes to the copied values.
   3. They must not do any asynchronous logic or have other “side effects”.
- The reducer function cannot do anything aside from returning a value

### Immutable Updates and Pure Functions

- A broad statement of these rules of reducers would be that reducers must perform **immutable** updates and be **pure functions**.
- Immutable upates are updates in which the thing to be modified is copied and the copy is modified, rather than the original argument.
- An example of mutating your argument would be:

```javascript
const mutableUpdater = (obj) => {
  obj.completed = !obj.completed;
  return obj;
}
```

and this is how we would use the same function immutably

```javascript
const immutableUpdater = (obj) => {
  return {
    ...obj,
    completed: !obj.completed
  }
}

const task = { text: 'iron clothes', completed: false };
const updatedTask = immutableUpdater(task);
console.log(updatedTask); 
// Prints { text: 'iron clothes', completed: true };

console.log(task); 
// Prints { text: 'iron clothes', completed: false };
```

   - The return statement contains a new object. And the `…` spread operator copies the original object into the new object. Then we can simply update the `completed` property.
- Plain strings, numbers and booleans are immutable in JS, so we can return them without making a copy
- A **pure function** always has the same outputs given the same inputs. If the value of a function depends on a remote endpoint. If you need to use an API call, pull it outside of the function and use promise chaining to call your reducer when the response returns.

### Store

- The store is the container for all of the control of data in Redux. It is where the reducer functions live, it is where state is initialized and it is where actions are disbatched to. The store is the single source of truth for the entire application.
