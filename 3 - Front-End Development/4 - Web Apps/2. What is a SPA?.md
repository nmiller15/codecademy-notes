# What is a SPA?

- A **single-page application**

### Multi-Page Applications

- In most websites, there are multiple pages. But, every time you click a link from one page to another, a request must be made of the server again. A single-page application can save the server requests, and a client's load times.

### Single-Page Applications

- Wikipedia definition: "a web application that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting teh current web page with new data from a web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages."
- The web page then remains the same file and JavaScript rewrites only the necessary parts of the page to change the view.

### SPA Frameworks

- You *can* do all of this just with vanilla JS, however, SPAs complexity scales rapidly, so there are tools to help with this:
   - React focuses on creating components that can render themselves differently based on an application’s current state and user data.

   - Vue.js uses templating within a single HTML file while the application controls what is rendered. This is thought to be more traditional.

   - There are others, and they all try to solve the same problems, however, they take different approaches.

   ### SPA Pros and Cons

   #### Pros

   - SPAs are fast
   - Reuse of code
   - SPAs make it easier to migrate to a mobile application, the back-end can remain the same while the mobile app UI is created

   #### Cons

   - Require move files to run at startup, so inital load times can be longer.
   - Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has some pitfalls. It’s hard for search engines to sort pages to rank the content if it is all one page. However, there are strategies to mitigate this.
   - Some browser controls may not do what is expected anymore, since you are on a single-page application.
