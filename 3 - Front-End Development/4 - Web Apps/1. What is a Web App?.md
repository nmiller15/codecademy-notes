### What is the Difference Between a Website and a Web Application?

- A website is *information-carrying* and inter-related pagesthat can be accessed through a browser.
- A web app runs on a web server and is accessed by the user through a browser.
- A web app is defined by its interaction with the user.

### Web Application Architecture

- Three-layered design:
   - Presentation layer (web browser), relays data to and from the application layer
   - Application layer (server) proccesses data in any number of ways
   - Storage layer (database) keeps data
- As apps get more complex, additional layers may need to be added. Possible an integration layer between the application and storage layers to make data easier to access.
