# React Router v6

### What is Routing?

- Routing is the process that a web app uses the current browser URL to determine what content to show a user.
- A URL is a request for some resource and each component helps to specify what resource is desired
- ::https://codecademy.com/articles?search=node::
   - ::protocol::
      - specifies which protocol to be used
      - http, https, mailto
   - ::domain::
      - specifies the website that hosts the resource
      - this is the entry point
   - ::path::
      - this is the identifier of the specific resource or page to be loaded
      - *this is where routing begins*
   - ::query::
      - An optional query string, appears after a `?` and assigns values to parameters

### Installing React Router

- To use React Router, we need to include the `react-router-dom` package, built specifically for web browsers in our project by using `npm`

```javascript
npm install --save react-router-dom@6
```

- This imports multiple routers, the most common one is `createBrowserRouter`
- The other options and reasons to use them:

[](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router)

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
const router = createBrowserRouter( /* application routes are defined here */ );
```

- `createBrowserRouter()` initializes our router and accepts a list of JSX componenets

### Providing a Router

- The different views of the application, called *routes*, are just React componenets.
- We need to make our router available to our entire application by using React Router’s `RouterProvider`

```javascript
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
const router = createBrowserRouter( /* application routes are defined here */ );

export default function App () {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={ router } />
  );
}
```

- `createBrowserRouter` defines a router that prevents URL changes from causing the page to reload -- URL changes instead allow the `router` to deteermine which of its routes to render while passing along information about the current URL's path as props

### Basic Routing with <Route>

- You can define paths for different views of your application in two different syntaxes: JSX or objects
- This lesson covers JSX, objects are covered in the following link

[](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route)

#### JSX Notation

- `.createBrowserRouter` takes in an array of `<Route>` objects
- To configure routes with JSX we must use `.createRoutesFromElements` mthod and the `<Route>` component to defind the routes

```javascript
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Route } from `react-router-dom`
```

- The `<Route>` componenet is designed to render (or not render) a component based on the current URL path. Each `<Route>` component should include:
   - A `path` prop with the value of the *exact URL path*
   - An `element` prop that describes the affected component
- Here is an example configuration of a `<Route>` that renders an `<About>` component when the URL matches `’/about’`

```javascript
import About from './About.js';
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElements(
  <Route path='/about' element={ <About/> } />
));

export default function App () {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={ router } />
  );
```

- If we wanted a componenet to render on every page we could configure it to a `<Root/>` component. We could also nest more elements between the `<Route>`'s tags and those will display as well.

```javascript
const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElements(
  <Route path='/' element={ <Root/> }>
    // nested routes here will render along with the <Root/> component
  </Route>
));
```

### Linking to Routes

- Typically, we make website nav links with `<a>` tags, but these will cause the page to reload, so we can use the `Link` and `NavLink` componenets instead to move between our views

```javascript
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
<NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>
```

- Starting the `to` prop with a `/` will assume that you are assigning from the root directory. It will be treated as an **absolute** path.
- `<NavLink>` automatically has an `.active` class assigned to it while its view is present which can be styled to indicate which content is being viewed.
- We could also style like this:

```javascript
<NavLink 
  to="about" 
  className={ ({ isActive }) => isActive? 'activeNavLink' : 'inactiveNavLink'}
  > About </NavLink>
```

### Dynamic Routes

- Sometimes we want URLs to be more dynamic. Imagine a ton of articles that are all accessed in an `articles` directory by their name. We should not route staticly to all of them, we should use a dynamic route
- Dynamic routes allow us to add **URL parameters** which will change. We add these placeholders by using a colon `:` followed by a variable name

```javascript
const route = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElement(
  <Route path='/articles/:title' element={ <Article /> }/>
))
```

- This example renders an `<Article/>` element when the user navigates to `/articles/what-is-react` or some other title
- When the `<Article/>` componenet is rendered it can access the actual value of that `:title` parameter to determine the article to display
- You could even put multiple parameters in each route. `articles/:title/comments/:commentID`
- This is a route for dynamic *resources.* So if you have a `<Route/>` set up for `<Articles/>` you’ll then have an `<Article/>` component that will render and the `<Article/>` *(without the s, picks different articles to display)* is the one that will take this routing

### useParams

- There is a hook, `useParams()` which allows us to display the value of our URL parameters. It returns an obejct that maps the names of URL Parameters to their values in the current URL.

```javascript
import { Link, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function Article() {
  
  let { title } = useParams();
  // title will be equal to the string 'objects'

  // The title will be rendered in the <h1>
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </article>
  );
}
```

- Like `useState()` this uses *destructuring assignment*

### Nested Routes

- If we want our routes to contain other routes, we can nest them within one another. For example, if we want a true relation betwen `/about` and `/about/secret` rather than them being separate, we could nest them like this:

```javascript
/* imports ... */
const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElement(
  <Route path='/about' element={ <About/> }> {/* About renders if path starts with /about */}
    <Route path='secret' element={ <Secret/> }>  />  {/* we can exclude /about from this path since it is relative to its parent */}
  </Route> 
));
```

- The `About` component will render when the path starts with `/about` and if the path matches `/about/secret` the `Secret` componenet will render in addition to the `About` component
- With this code, we still need to tell `About` where to render the `Secret` component, since `Secret` is now a child element. So we do that with React Router's `Outlet` component

```javascript
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

// Rendered when the user visits '/about'
export default function About() {
  return (
    <main>
       <h1>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h1>
       <Outlet/>  {/* renders child element when user visits /about/secret */}
    <main/>   
  );
}
```

   - We could also use an **index route** instead with nested routes. This will take an `index` prop instead of a `path prop` but it will render on the parent's path

```javascript
/* imports ... */
const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElement(
  <Route path='/about' element={ <About/> }> {/* About renders if path starts with /about */}
    <Route index element={ <IndexComponent/> }>  />  {/* Will render when the path is /about */}
    <Route path='secret' element={ <Secret/> }>  />  {/* Will render when the path is /about/secret */}
  </Route> 
));
```

- An index route is a **default** `Route` that will rener in its parent's `Outlet` when the path matches the parent `path` exactly so there's some content in that space

# <Navigate>

- `<Navigate>` is similar to `<Nav>` and `<NavLink>` however, it is a componenet that automatically navigates the user to the next page. This is typically done as a result of some form of condition.
- This is handy for redirects, when a user wants to go somewhere that we can’t display data - such as a profile page, when a user isn’t logged in
- This is called redirecting “declaritively"

### useNavigate

- React Router also provides a way to navigate imperitively - the `useNavigate` hook.
- We might want to use this because the `Navigate` component adds some steps to the rendering lifecycle
   1. The `Navigate` component must be returned
   2. The `Navigate` component is then rendered
   3. The URL is updated
   4. The appropriate route is rendered
- To use `useNavigate`
   - Import from `'react-router-dom'`
   - Declare to a variable - it will return a function
   - Use the function to navigate passing arguments
      - Pass the path to go there
      - Pass an integer to access a user’s history i.e. `navigate(-1)` to go back or `navigate(1)` to go forward, or `navigate(-3)` to go back 3

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from `react-router-dom`

export const BackButton = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>
      Go Back
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Query Parameters

- Query parameters appear in URLs after a `?` and then they are represented by key value pairs where the key is the parameter name.
   - i.e. `https://www.google.com/search?q=codecademy`
   - You would go to `/search` and the query parameter is `q` with a value of `codecademy`
- These parameters can determine what content to display to the user. We can grab query parameter values with the `useSearchParams()` hook
- Like `useState()` this returns an object (`URLSearchParams`) and a setter, but the object contains the search parameters from the URL

```javascript
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';

// Rendered when a user visits "/list?order=DESC"
export const SortedList = (numberList) => {
  const [ searchParams, setSearchParams ] = useSearchParams();
  const sortOrder = searchParams.get('order');
  console.log(sortOrder); // Prints "DESC"
};
```

- The `URLSearchParams` object, called `searchParams` in this example, has a `.get()` method which returns the value for a given parameter value.
- This logic can be expanded

```javascript
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom'

// Rendered when a user visits "/list?order=DESC"
export const SortedList = (numberList) => {
  const [ searchParams, setSearchParams ] = useSearchParams();
  const sortOrder = searchParams.get('order');

  if (sortOrder === 'ASC') {
    // render the numberList in ascending order
  } else if (sortOrder === 'DESC') {
    // render the numberList in descending order
  } else {
    // render the numberList as is
  }
}
```

- You can also use the setter to change the values of the params which will update the URL and subsequently the content

```javascript
import { useSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';

// Rendered when a user visits "/list"
export const List = (numberList) => {
  const [ searchParams, setSearchParams ] = useSearchParams();

  // render the numberList in ascending order
  <button click={ () => setSearchParams( {order: 'ASC'} ) }>
    Sort 
  </button>
}
```

- If we wanted to navigate to a path and then access query parameters that aren't there yet, we'd use the `createSearchParams()` utility function with the `useNavigate` hook

```javascript
import { useNavigate, createSearchParams } from 'react-router-dom';
// get navigate function
const navigate = useNavigate();

// define an object where the key is is the query parameter name and value is query parameter value
const searchQueryParams = {
  order: 'ASC'
}

// use createSearchParams which takes an object and transforms it to a query string of the form order=ASC
const searchQueryString = createSearchParams(searchQueryParams);

// force a navigate by passing in an object with pathname indicating that path to navigate and search indicating the query parameters to append
navigate({
  pathname:'/list',
  search: `?${searchQueryString}`
})
```

- `createSearchParams` will accept an object of query parameters and convert it to a query string, it does not add the `?` for you
