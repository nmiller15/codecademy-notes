# React Forms

- In a React form, we want the server to know about every new charaacter or deletion *as soon as it happens*. This keeps the screen in sync with the rest of the application.
- So, we’re not just waiting for the submit button to be pressed

### Input onChange

- We manage the state of a form in React, by giving it an `onChange` event listener

### Write an Input Event Handler

- This works the same as in [Hooks](https://docs.craft.do/editor/d/b4ae036d-e2e6-fd10-7e5e-f12ec518b2e1/CA578467-1DA9-4F84-BEE2-B119C3D19227/x/D77457A0-5A81-476B-8105-D79532D4B55D)

### Set the Input’s Initial State

- See [The State Hook](https://docs.craft.do/editor/d/b4ae036d-e2e6-fd10-7e5e-f12ec518b2e1/CA578467-1DA9-4F84-BEE2-B119C3D19227/x/04F52361-D55B-406F-9F9F-8E150AE52D68)

### Update an Input’s Value

- See [The State Hook](craftdocs://open?blockId=04F52361-D55B-406F-9F9F-8E150AE52D68&spaceId=b4ae036d-e2e6-fd10-7e5e-f12ec518b2e1)

### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

- **controlled componenet** - one that does not maintain its internal state
- **uncontrolled component** - one that *does* maintain tis internal state
- A controlled componenet must have its state controlled by another componenet
- So with an `<input>` field, by default it is uncontrolled, because it is keeping track of its own values, but we want it to be controlled in most cases, so that the information remains consistent
