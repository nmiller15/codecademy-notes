# React Styles

### Inline Styles and Style Object Variables

- Inline styles are written as attribues `<h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world<h1>`
   - Outer curly braces signal JS
   - Inner curly braces signal the object literal
- You can also just store a style object in a variable and inject that variable as the value of the `style` attribute

```javascript
const darkMode = {
  color: 'white',
  background: 'black'
}

//
<h1 style={darkmode}>Hello World</h1>
```

### Style Syntax

- CSS property names are the same in JSX, but they will be camelCased instead of dash-noted
- In JS the values will always be strings, but if you do put a number in, the unit `'px'` will be assumed

### Multiple Stylesheets

- It is good practice to keep separate stylesheets for each componenet

```javascript
import './App.css'
```

- We want to use CSS modules. If we import as a module, the styles are only available for the componenet that imported the style
- To use CSS modules, name stylesheets using the following format where `fileName` is the name of the componenet being styled:
   - `fileName.module.css`
- Then import into the file containing the componenet:

```javascript
import styles from ‘./fileName.module.css’
```

- After the import, the `styles` object will hold class selectors of the file:

```javascript
<div className={styles.divStyle}></div>
```

- `className` is the same as `class` in HTML. `class` is reserved in JS
