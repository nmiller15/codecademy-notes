# Learn React Testing with Jest

[Jest Tutorial for Beginners: Getting Started With JavaScript Testing](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/jest/)

- Jest is a JavaScript test runner - it is a library for creating, running and structuring tests
- Jest is an npm package that can be installed in any JavaScript project
- We should test every page of the app and every user interaction, but there may also be other functions and modules that need tested as well.
- Here’s a typical test flow in Jest
   1. import the function to test
   2. give an input to the function
   3. define what to expect as the output
   4. check in the function produces the expected output

### Setting Up the Project

- We need to a have an npm environment

```other
mkdir getting-started-with-jest && cd $_
npm init -y
```

- Then we install jest with:

```other
npm i jest --save-dev
```

- Then we need to configure a script for running our tests from the command line

```javascript
// In package.json
"scripts" : {
  "test": "jest"
},
```

### Specifications and test-driven development

- Jest expects to find test files in a folder called `__tests__` in your project folder

```other
mkdir __test__
```

- Then we set up a file called `filterByTerm.spec.js` inside of our `__tests__` directory.
   - The `.spec` extension is a convention borrowed from Ruby for marking the file as a specification for a given functionality

### Test structure, and a first failing test

- Jest follows a `describe` `test` framework.

```javascript
describe("Filter function", () => {
  test("it should filter by a search term (link)", () => {
    // actual test
  })
})
```

- This is the basic framework, now we put together **inputs, functions, and expected outputs.**
- So we would want to use dummy data probably
- After our input and expected outputs are defined, we will use `expect` to test with a Jest matcher

```javascript
describe("Filter function", () => {
  test("it should filter by a search term (link)", () => {
    // Define an input
    const input = [
      {id: 1, url: "https://www.url1.dev"},
      {id: 2, url: "https://www.url2.dev"},
      {id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev"},
    ]
    // Define the expected output
    const output = [{ id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev"}];

    // expect()'s argument is how you would call a given function
    // regularly in your code
    expect(filterByTerm(input, "link")).toEqual(output);
  })
})
```

- Once your test is written you can try it with

```other
npm test
```

- Then, because we don't have a function yet:

```other
FAIL  __tests__/filterByTerm.spec.js
  Filter function
    ✕ it should filter by a search term (2ms)

  ● Filter function › it should filter by a search term (link)

    ReferenceError: filterByTerm is not defined

       9 |     const output = [{ id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev" }];
      10 | 
    > 11 |     expect(filterByTerm(input, "link")).toEqual(output);
         |     ^
      12 |   });
      13 | });
      14 |
```

### Fixing the test (and breaking it again)

- Define the function `filterByTerm` in another file and import it to the test file.
- Make the test pass with the least amount of code possible.
- Then BREAK it.
- Then fix it again!

```javascript
function filterByTerm(inputArr, searchTerm) {
  return inputArr.filter(function(arrayElement) {
    return arrayElement.url.match(searchTerm);
  });
}
```

- Now after `npm test`

```other
PASS  __tests__/filterByTerm.spec.js
  Filter function
    ✓ it should filter by a search term (link) (4ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.836s, estimated 1s
```

- Now let's add a condition to the test that will break. Like an uppercase search term

```javascript
describe("Filter function", () => {
  test("it should filter by a search term (link)", () => {
    const input = [
      { id: 1, url: "https://www.url1.dev" },
      { id: 2, url: "https://www.url2.dev" },
      { id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev" }
    ];

    const output = [{ id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev" }];

    expect(filterByTerm(input, "link")).toEqual(output);

    expect(filterByTerm(input, "LINK")).toEqual(output); // New test

  });
});
```

- So we could have it take a case insensitive regular expression instead. So now the function is:

```javascript
function filterByTerm(inputArr, searchTerm) {
  const regex = new RegExp(searchTerm, "i");
  return inputArr.filter(function(arrayElement) {
    return arrayElement.url.match(regex);
  });
}
```

### Code Coverage in Jest

- As code is maintained by you and by teams, it is easy to forget to write a test for everything, and to know where there are untested units.
- Jest has build in coverage monitoring
- We can use Jest’s built-in code coverage through the command line passing `--coverage` or by configuring Jest in `package.json`
- `npm test -- --coverage`

```other
PASS  __tests__/filterByTerm.spec.js
  Filter function
    ✓ it should filter by a search term (link) (3ms)
    ✓ it should filter by a search term (uRl) (1ms)
    ✓ it should throw when searchTerm is empty string (2ms)

-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
File             |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files        |     87.5 |       75 |      100 |      100 |                   |
 filterByTerm.js |     87.5 |       75 |      100 |      100 |                 3 |
-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
```

- If you don't want to have to call coverage this way every time, just add it to `package.json`

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
"jest": {
  "collectCoverage": true
},
```

or pass the flag to the test script

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --coverage"
},
```

you can also have an HTML report for code coverage

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
"jest": {
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageReporters": ["html"]
},
```

now, `npm test` will create a folder called `coverage` in your project folders. The `index.html` file will show you what is covered
