# React Programming Patterns

### Separate Container Componenets From Presentational Componenets

- If a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn't aslo have to render JSX
- The pattern weâ€™ll learn about focuses on splitting complex components into stateful (container) and stateless (presentational) componenets, where stateful comonents manage complex state or logic and stateless components only render JSX.

### Create Container Componenet

- The functional part of a component, one that maintains a state, or makes calculations can be separated into a container componenet, also known as a stateful componenet.

### Create Presentational Componenet

- The presentational component's only job is to contain JSX
- It should be an exported component and should not render itself because **a presentational componenet will always get rendered by a container componenet**.

### Parent/Child and Sibling/Sibling Communication

- Container componenets can communicate with presentational componenets by passing state through props
- For a presentation to update a container, the container must define and provide a way for the presentational componenet to communicate with it using a change handler function passed as a prop.

```javascript
function Container() {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);                              
                                
  return (
    <>
      <Presentational active={isActive} toggle={setIsActive}/>
      <OtherPresentational active={isActive}/>
    </>
    );                          
  }
                        
function Presentational(props) {
  return (
    <h1>Engines are {props.active}</h1>
    <button onClick={() => props.toggle(!props.active)}>Engine Toggle</button>
  );
}
                            
function OtherPresentational(props) {
  // render...
}
```

- These are three separate components
- `OtherPresentational` is here to show that, if you change the `isActive` state from the `Presentational` componenet, since that state is stored in `Container` it will also be passed down to `OtherPresentational`
- This is indirect communication between siblings, or componenets that share a parent component

### Render Presentational Componenets in Container Component

- The container componenet should render presentational componenets rather than directly rendering JSX
- The container passes down state as props to teh presentation componenets to keep them reactive
