# Advanced JSX

### class vs className

- JSX cannot use the word `class` like HTML can, so you have to use `className` instead.
- `class` is a reserved word in JS
- `className` is rendered as `class` in the DOM

### Self-Closing Tags

- The optional `/` in self-closing tags in HTML is required in JSX
- `<br />` `<img />` `<input />`

### JavaScript in Your JSX In Your JavaScript

- JS isn't going to behave like JS when inside of JSX elements, however, if we add curly braces, it will.
- `<h1>{2 + 3}<h1>`

### Variable in JSX

- JavaScript in JSX is in the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in the file. Meaning that it can access the global scope.

### Variable Attributes in JSX

- Common to use JSX to set *attributes*, could look like this:

```javascript
const sideLength = "200px";

const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
);
```

- Object properties are also often set this way

```javascript
const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5",
  owl: "http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3",
  owlCat: "http://bit.ly/1Upbczi"
}; 

const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);

const owl = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owl} 
    alt="Unimpressed Owl" />
);

const owlCat = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owlCat} 
    alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
);
```

### Event Listeners in JSX

- Just like HTML elements you can add *event listeners* to JSX elements
- React is kinda all about event listeners.
- `<img onClick={clickAlert} />`
[](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#)

   - browse supported event names
- The value of an event listener attribute should be a function. so `clickAlert` would need to be a valid function for that to work.

### JSX Conditionals: If Statments

- You can not inject an `if` statement into a JSX expression
- Here’s an option:

```javascript
if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}
```

### JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator

- The JavaScript ternary operator works the same in React.
- `x ? y : z`
   - If `x` is truthy, the the operator returns `y`
   - if `x` is falsy, the operator returns `z`

```javascript
const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
```

### JSX Conditionals: &&

- Works just as in vanilla JS
- `&&` is good for conditionals that will sometimes do something and sometimes do nothing

```javascript
const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
```

- If left of `&&` is true then JSX on the right will render

### .map in JSX

- `.map()` is probably the most common way to make a list in React

```javascript
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];

const listItems = strings.map(string => <li>{string}</li>);

<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

- You can pass JSX in an array (like `.map()` will, however you don't have to!

```javascript
// This is fine in JSX, not in an explicit array:
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
</ul>

// This is also fine!
const liArray = [
  <li>item 1</li>, 
  <li>item 2</li>, 
  <li>item 3</li>
];

<ul>{liArray}</ul>
```

### Keys

- `key` is a JSX attribute that will help React track list items

```javascript
<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul>
```

- Not all list items need keys, but they *do* if:
   - Items have *memory* from one render to the next - a to-do list - does the item need to remember anything?
   - a list’s order might be shuffled
- Keys are unique to each list item
- Probably just use them, it doesn’t take long and its not going to interfere with anything.

### React.createElement

- You can use React without JSX though too, even though most programmers don't do this:

```javascript
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

// can be refactored to 

const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello world"
);
// A React compiler will turn JSX into the second example
```

- Check out [documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement) if you want more information on the syntax
