# React: The Virtual DOM

### The Problem

- Many JavaScript frameworks reload, or repaint the DOM every time a change is made, no matter how small. This doesn't always make sense though.
- Having a browser compare a mock DOM and the current DOM and only make those changes would actually be slower than repainting the whole page.
- To deal with this, React popularized something called the virtual DOM.

### The Virtual DOM

- In React, every DOM object has a corresponding "virtual DOM object," which is a representation of a DOM object.
- These lightweight copies carry the same properties, but doesn’t directly change what’s on the screen.
- It’s much faster to manipulate the virtual DOM, and frameworks like React can scan changes on a virtual DOM much quicker

### How it Helps

- When a JSX element is rendered, every virtual DOM object is updated, but it is not inefficient because a virtual DOM can update so quickly.
- Once the virtual DOM is updated, the updated version is compared to a *snapshot* that was taken right before the update and can tell only the vDOM objects that have changed
   - This process is called **diffing**
