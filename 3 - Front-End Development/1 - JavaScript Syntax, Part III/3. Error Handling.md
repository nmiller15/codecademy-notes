# Error Handling

- *Error handling* is the process of programmatically anticipating and addressing errors.
- We will use the keywords
   - `try`
   - `catch`
- These keywords will allow us to let a program continue to run

### Constructing an Error

- JavaScript errors are objets and they have name and message properties.
- We can use the `Error()` function to create custom errors, like throwing an error to a user if they are inputting something invalid.

```javascript
console.log(Error('Your password is too weak'));
```

- You can also add the keyword  `new` before Error in this syntax and it will produce the same result.
- Creating an error will not stop the program from running, throwing an error will.

### The throw Keyword

- Use the `throw` keyword to stop a program from continuing to run after the Error is read.

```javascript
throw Error('Something wrong happened');
// Error: Something wrong happened

console.log('This will never run');
```

### The try…catch Statement

```javascript
try {
  throw Error('This error will get caught')
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
// Prints: This error will get caught

console.log('The thrown error that was caught in the try...catch statement!');
// Prints the above string
```

- e represents the thrown error
