# Modules

### Implementing Modules using ES6 Syntax

- A *module* is a piece of code in a file that can be exported and then imported for use in another file.
- A *modular program* has componenets that can be separated, used individually, and recombined to create complex systems
- *Module* and *file* are often used interchangably
- Instead of putting the entire code for an app in one file, we can separate concerns by putting tasks alone in their own files
- The module syntax is different depending on the runtime environment.
   - Node runtime prefers `module.exports` and `require()`
   - Browser’s runtime and the ES6 prefers `import`/`export` syntax
- ES6
   - Make sure that the module is in its own file, and that file is accessbile to both of the files that need to use it
   - Inside the module file `export { resourceToExportA, resourceToExportB, ...}`
      - Where a resourceToExport is something in the file, a function or block of code, that you would like to make available outside of that file
      - This won’t work just on your local computer without a local server, but you can create a local server with VSCode [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/spinning-up-a-local-server](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/spinning-up-a-local-server)
      - Modules can also be exported by line by just adding the keyword `export` in fronr of the line
   - Then import the resources into the receiving module `import { exportedResourceA, exportedResourceB } from '/path/to/module.js';`
   - Once imported, ensure that in the HTML the script element for your file is set to `type="module"`
