# Monitoring and Maintaining a Deployed Render Application

## Deployment Monitoring

Built into Render are some monitoring tools that we can use:

Events: to track deployment events

- First deploy
- Deploy live
- Deploy started
- Deploy canceled
- Deploy failed

Under events we can also re-deploy previous successful deployments

Metrics: track usage and bandwidth, uptime

## Deployment Maintenance

Modifying settings after deployment:

- Which repo are we pulling from
- Auto Deployment - enable or disable
- Custom Domains - where is the site hosted
- PR Previews - get URL previews of the full stack application before it is sent to production
- Health and Alerts - get notifications when something fails
- Delete or suspend - suspended resources will not be billed, deleted events will not retain any history or content
