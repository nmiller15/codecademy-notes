# Cross-Site Reqest Forgery (CSRF) Attacks

Cross-Site Request Forgery is a vulnerabiliity where an attacker gets a validated user, potentially with an active session to click on a link or submit a request on an attacker’s behalf.

Just for example, if an attacker were to phish a user who was logged into a bank account and got them to click on this link:

```plaintext
http://bank.com/send?recipient=Attacker&amount=2000
```

The user who is already authenticated would be sending this request unknowingly. The link would likely be shortened or hyperlinked in disguise.

In general, CSRF tends to be targeted at web requests that are “state-changing” rather than ones that return meaningful data. “State-changing” requests are requests that perform an action to change a user account or status of an object on a website, things like: payment for a product, changing account information, transferring funds, changing security settings, etc.

## Preventing CSRF

While the attacks are highly detrimental, they are relatively easy to mitigate.

Adding a CSRF token, a dynamically-generated, unique value, used only with the form that the user is currently on can be sent by the server to verify all requests. This is very secure, but can still fail if XSS is used to extract the token.

Re-authentication before critical requests is another way to add additional checks before allowing changes to critical or sensitive information.
