# Remediation and Incident Response

NIST - United States National Institute of Standards and Technology

CSRC - Computer Security Research Center

## Remediation

Remediation is the process of fixing a security issue. It is not necessarily reactive, in fact, th best remediation occurs before the attack does!

## Incident Response

Incident reponse happens after a security incident. Something has happened, and now there needs to be a recovery.

### Incident Reponse Lifecycle

1. Preparation

Before an incident occurs. Training, access control, response plans.

1. Detection
2. Analysis and Investigation

disclosure, communication with law enforcement, analysis of attack vectors and scope

4. Remediation

May be delayed by analysis. Fixes to ensure that this doesnâ€™t happen again. Recovering lost resources where possible

1. Review
