# Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS)

In general, XSS is where an attacker gets a website to run unsanitized input in the form of JavaScript  on the client side of an application for other users. This can enable the attacker to steal sensitive user data, redirect pages, or completely take control of the browser.

## Stored XSS

This is one of the most serious forms of XSS, it occurs when a malicious input is stored on a web server and is potentially served to all other visitors to the site. For example, if an attcker were to write malicious code in an unstanitized comment input on a website, this could be served any time that a user tries to load the comment.

## Reflected XSS

In this attack, no data is stored by the server, but it requires a situation where there is an immediate response to the user, like a login page, or a search box. An example of reflected XSS is where an attacker sends a script-injected URL to a target user, and they click it, filling out their information. The link sends the user to the actual site, while the script returns the login information to the attacker.

## DOM-Based XSS

When the DOM is affected by user input, an attacker can inject malicious code here. This occurs solely on the client side and does not affect how the server responds.

## Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

To see if our site has any XSS vulnerabilities, we should check ever user input on the site. We will check with a proof-of-concept payload (or a POC payload). A POC payload should demonstrate that a vulnerability exists without doing any damage. Here’s an example:

```html
<script>alert(1);</script>
```

If our inputs are not being properly sanitized, a web browser that displays this information will open a popup box.

This is only the most basic way to check, since the `script` tag may be sanitized, but there are other ways that an attacker can work their way in:

```html
<img src="X" onerror=alert(1);>
```

```html
<b onmouseover=alert(1)>click me!</b>
```

```html
<body onload=alert('test1')>
```

## Preventing XSS Vulnerabilities

### Sanitation

Sanitation is the process of removing or replacing potentially problematic characters and strings. Depending on the language being used, there may be built in packages for this, like `sanitize-html` for JavaScript.

Without a module, replacing the characters `<` `>` `”` and `=` should prevent most attacks, however, it may not be enough to prevent all.
