# Monitoring

## What is Monitoring?

Monitoring is a feedback loop that is generated from our deployment environments. It’s a set of technical proctices and tools that will tell us what is happening in the system. To monitor, we define and expose measurements we want to see while the system is running.

## Goals of Monitoring

The goal of monitoring is to save time and money in issue discovery and remediation. Effective monitoring can detect issues before they are presented to users, and present them to engineers to be fixed. Alerts should include information about *what* is wrong but also *why* it went wrong as well.

## What Should We Measure?

### Request Metrics

- Number of Incoming requests
- Response time
- Error Responses

### Server Metrics

- Hardware usage
- Uptime

## Obervability - Measuring Monitoring

Observability is the ability to use a systm’s information to locate and fix a problem.

### Issue Metrics

- How long did it take to notice a system issue?
- How long did it take to locate the cuase of the issue?

### Alert Metrics

- False negatives
- False positives
- Unactionable alerts
