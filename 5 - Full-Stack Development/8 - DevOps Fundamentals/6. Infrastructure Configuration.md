# Infrastructure Configuration

## What is Infrastructure Configuration?

### Provisioning

This is the setting up of servers, network equipment, and other infrastructure.

To provision a server:

1. Ops team must acquire a server and install OS
2. Configure the IP address, hostname, firewall and DNS
3. Connect it to the network

In the cloud, provisioning means to spin up a virtual machine, but there is also:

- Network provisioning: setting up network components
- User provisioning: creating users, groups and priveleges
- Service provisioning: distributing cloud services

An infrastructure must be provisioned before it can be configured.

### Configuration

This is the customization of provisioned resources:

- installing dependencies
- Updating to a specific OS version
- Setting up logging
- Create databse configurations

Configuration is an ongoing process and one that gets more difficult as infrastructures scale.

### Problems

- **Cost**: Large-scale infrastructure requires a large staff to perform repetitive tasks
- **Scalability:** Provisioning can be time-consuming as demands for scaling rise
- **Configuration Drift:** Manual setup is error prone, creating inconsistent configurations.
- **Poor Visibility:** It can be diffiicult to locate misconfigurations on multiple machines.

## Modern Infrastructure Configuration

To mitigate problems associated with manual configuration and to bring configuration practices up to the standard of development practices, tools, automation and new ideas were incorporated.

### Infrastructure as Code

IaC is definining infrastructure in configuration files that are stored and tracked in version control.

Best Practices:

- Config files should be in version control
- Config files should be the source of truth
- Changes to config files should be tested before deployment
- Provisioning and config should be as automated as possible

IaC is faster, more consistent, visible, and because of that, it is much less costly.

### IaC Tools

#### Orchestration vs. Management

IaC tools specialize in on of the following:

- *Configuration orchestration -* provisioning of cloud resrouces
[Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/)

- *Configuration management -* maintaining a desired state in provisioned resources

[Puppet Infrastructure &amp; IT Automation at Scale | Puppet by Perforce](https://puppet.com/)

#### Declarative vs. Imperative

Configuration files can either be declarative, where they describe the desired state of the infrastructre, or imperative, listing specific commands, in order, needed for configuring infrastrucure.

Declarative is *WHAT*. Imperative is *HOW*.
