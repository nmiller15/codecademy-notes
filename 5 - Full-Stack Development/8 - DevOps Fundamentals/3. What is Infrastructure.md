# What is Infrastructure/Traditional Infrastructure?

## What is Infrastructure?

Infrastructure is the hardware and software used to develop, test, and deploy applications. The infrastructure of an application should seek to provide a rapid and positive UX, maintain uptime and protect users.

## Problems with Traditional Infrastructure

Traditionally, companies would host the infrastructure of an application (routers, servers, software, etc.) “on-premesis”. This means the company is responsible for keeping the software on the hardware up to date, fixing issues that come up, ensuring that a trained staff is available, keeping hardware secure, etc.

Many businesses are opting to move to the cloud to avoid having to deal with all of this overhead, using someone else’s infrastructure that is well maintained instead.

## The Role of the Operations Team

Operations are primarily responsible for maintaining the business application infrastructure. This means anything from installing physical equipment, performing upgrades, configuring, and monitoring networks etc.

In a DevOps culture, Development and Operations members share some of these responsibilities.
