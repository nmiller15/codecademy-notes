# Continuous Integration

## What is Continuous Integration?

CI is all about merging source code changes frequently, and building and testing changes automatcially.

Using CI, we may move away from feature branch development.

## Feature Branch Development

Traditional source control management approaches uses feature branches for each new feature, keeping code separate from the rest of the base until it is finished. This is fine for small projects with little collaboration, but as features get larger their reviews are long and their conflicts with main are many.

CI instead encourages the frequent merging, building and testing of code changes on the *main* branch. Only *one* branch!

## Trunk-Based Development

This is the frequent merging of small changes into the main branch (the trunk). It helps discover probelms early (“shifting left”) instead of at the end of a merge attempt. Since the changes are small, there are less conflicts and with simpler fixes.

## Implementing CI

To implement CI on an entire project:

1. Make sure that the project is on one main source branch.
2. Pick on the the many CI servers to aontrol automatic builds and tests.
3. Configure the CI server to trigger automatic builds when merges occur.
4. Develop tests and configure the CI server to run them.
5. Set up notifications for build or test failures.

With CI, your codebase is always in a deploy-ready state!
