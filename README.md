Keep up with what I'm learning through my Codecademy Full-Stack Developer Professional Certification! These serve as my own abridged documentation on the many technologies, methodologies, and best practices I've been learning through the program!

If you're interested in learning, I can't reccommend Codecademy's [Career Paths](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/all) enough! I signed up for Pro in January, and it was a very worthwhile investment so far!
