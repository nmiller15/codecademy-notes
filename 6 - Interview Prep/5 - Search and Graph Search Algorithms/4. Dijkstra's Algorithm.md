# Dijkstra’s Algorithm

If we need to find the shortest distance between two vertexes on a weighted graph, we use **Dijkstra's algorithm**. Here are the steps:

1. Instantiate a dictionary that will eventually map vertices to their distance from the start vertex.
2. Assign the start vertex a distance of 0 in a min heap
3. Assign every other vertex a distance of infinity in a min heap
4. Remove the vertex with the smallest distance from the min heap and set that to the current vertex
5. For the current vertex, consider all of its adjacent vertices and calculate the distance to them as

**(distance to the current vertex) + (edge weight of current vertex to adjacent vertex)**

1. If this new distance is less than the current distance, replace the current distance.
2. Repeat 4 and 5 until the heap is empty
3. After the heap is empty, return the distances

## Conceptual Runtime

To run Dijkstra’s algorithm, you must

- search through the graph
- keep track of distances

Dijkstras will run, in the worst case, the amount of times it takes to get through all of the graph, the amount of the vertices and edges combined, O(E+V). To keep track of distances though, we also need to update a min-heap, meaning that we also have a runtime of O(log V) for the heap.

So to combine, we have a runtime of O((E+V)log V) > O(N log N)

## Implementation

In pseudo code:

```plaintext
distances = {}
previous = {}
queue = priority queue

add starting vertex to queue

for every vertex in the graph:
  distances[vertex] = Infinity
  previous[vertex] = null

distances[starting vertex] = 0

while there are vertices in the queue:
  dequeue vertex from queue

  for every neighbor in vertex:
    alternate = distances[vertex] + distance from vertex to neighbor

    if alternate less than distances[neighbor]:
      distances[neighbor] = alternate
      previous[neighbor] = vertex
      add neighbor to queue
```

```javascript
// djikstras.js
const PriorityQueue = require('./PriorityQueue.js');

const dijkstras = (graph, startingVertex) => {
	const distances = {};
	const previous = {};
	const queue = new PriorityQueue();

	queue.add({ vertex: startingVertex, priority: 0 });

	graph.vertices.forEach((vertex) => {
		distances[vertex.data] = Infinity;
		previous[vertex.data] = null;
	});
	distances[startingVertex.data] = 0;

	while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
		const { vertex } = queue.popMin();

		vertex.edges.forEach((edge) => {
			const alternate = edge.weight + distances[vertex.data];
			const neighborValue = edge.end.data;

			if (alternate < distances[neighborValue]) {
				distances[neighborValue] = alternate;
				previous[neighborValue] = vertex;

				queue.add({ vertex: edge.end, priority: distances[neighborValue] })
			}
		})
	}

	return { distances, previous };
};

module.exports = dijkstras;
