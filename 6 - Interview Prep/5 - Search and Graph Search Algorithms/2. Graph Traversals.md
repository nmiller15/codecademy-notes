# Graph Traversals

Three primary methods of traversing a graph are, depth-first (DFS), breadth-first (BFS), and Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Depth first is primarily used for detecting cycles, and topological sorting, and is particularly good at problems that have a single correct answer. To implement a depth first search algorithm, you will search from your starting point and follow one

Breadth-first checks the values of all neighboring berticies before moving into another depth. It’s not good at finding paths between vertecies, but it good at identifying the shortest path, so it’s good with finding directions. To implement breadth-first, you will exhaust all of the vonnections to a vertex before moving down the level.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a method for finding the shortest distance from a given point to every other point in a weighted graph, it keeps track of all thedistances and updates the distances as it conducts a breadth-first search.

## Depth-First Search Using an Array and a Stack

When we’re doing a depth-first search, we need to track which node’s we’ve already visited, and a stack to traverse them all. Check this out.

With this graph:

Starting at one, you would have to do this to traverse every node:

```plaintext
Starting at Node 1 we will traverse the graph going with the lowest value first.
We could choose any value though, for example we will do the first.
..add 1 to the visited array
..add 1 to the dfs stack
... visited = [1]
... dfsStack = [1]

From one the next highest vertex is 2
..add two to the visited array
..add two to the dfs stack
... visited = [1, 2]
... dfsStack = [2, 1]

From 2, the lowest is 1, but it's already been visited, so we go to 4
.. add four to the visited array
.. add four to the dfs stack
... visited = [1, 2, 4]
... dfsStack = [4, 2, 1]

Since 2 is already visited, from four we can only go to 9
.. add nine to the visited array
.. add nine to the dfs stack
... visited = [1, 2, 4, 9]
... dfsStack = [9, 4, 2, 1]

Since 4 is already visited, from nine we can only go to 7
.. add seven to the visited array
.. add seven to the dfs stack
... visited = [1, 2, 4, 9, 7]
... dfsStack = [7, 9, 4, 2, 1]

Seven's only connections have already been visited, so we have to 
pop from the stack until we find a number that has an available connection
.. pop seven
... dfsStack = [9, 4, 2, 1]

.. nine's edges all visited
.. pop nine
... dfsStack = [4, 2, 1]

.. four's edges all visited
.. pop four
... dfsStack = [2, 1]

Two has an available edge, eight
.. add eight to visited
.. add eight to the dfsStack
... visited = [1, 2, 4, 9, 8]
... dfsStack = [8, 2, 1]

.. eight's edges all visited
.. pop eight
... dfsStack = [2, 1]

.. two's edges all visited
.. pop two
... dfsStack = [1]

One has an unvisited edge, so we go to three
.. add three to visited
.. add three to dfsStack
... visisted = [1, 2, 4, 9, 8, 3]
... dfsStack = [3, 1]

Three's lowest is one, but already visisted, so next lowest is 5
.. add five to visited
.. add five to dfsStack
... visisted = [1, 2, 4, 9, 8, 3, 5]
... dfsStack = [5, 3, 1]

.. all of five's edges visited
.. pop five
... dfsStack = [3, 1]

Three has an available edge that's unvisited
.. add six to visited
.. add six to dfsStack
... dfsStack = [6, 3, 1]

We have visited all nodes! .. but the algorithm still needs to clear the stack

.. six has no unvisisted
.. pop six
... dfsStack = [3, 1]

.. three has no unvisited
.. pop three
... dfsStack = [1]

.. one has no unvisited
.. pop one
... dfsStack = []

stack is empty. algorithm complete
```

## Traversing Breadth-First

Instead of using a stack, we will use a queue to keep track of where to go! We will still use a visited array though.

Using the same graph, but going breadth first

```plaintext
Starting breadth first search
... currentNode = 1
... queue = [1]

.. checking all connected nodes for unvisited nodes
.. adding all connected nodes to the queue
.. adding all connected nodes to the visisted array
... queue = [1, 2, 3]
... visited = [1, 2, 3]

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [2, 3]
... currentNode = 2

.. checking all connected nodes
.. adding all connnected notes to the queue
... queue = [2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
... visited = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [3, 4, 7, 8]
... currentNode = 3

.. checking all connected nodes
.. adding all connnected notes to the queue
... queue = [3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6]
... visited = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6]

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [4, 7, 8, 5, 6]
... currentNode = 4

.. checking all connected nodes
.. ignoring visited value: 2
.. adding all connnected notes to the queue
... queue = [4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9]
... visited = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9]

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [7, 8, 5, 6, 9]
... currentNode = 7

--- All Nodes have been visisted, but the algorithm must clear the queue
--- to know this.

.. checking all connected nodes

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [8, 5, 6, 9]
... currentNode = 8

.. checking all connected nodes

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [5, 6, 9]
... currentNode = 5

.. checking all connected nodes

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [6, 9]
... currentNode = 6

.. checking all connected nodes

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue and resetting currentNode to head of queue
... queue = [9]
... currentNode = 9

.. checking all connected nodes

.. all connected nodes visisted for currentNode
.. popping queue 
... queue = []

algorithm complete
```

## Graph Search Traversal Order

If you need to get a list of all the values in a graph, depth-first search is good at organizing vertices with a clear order of visitation from beginning to end.

There are three main traversal orders for graph traversal:

- *Preorder*, each vertex is added to "visited" and output list BEFORE going to the stack
- *Postorder,* each vertex is added to teh “visited list and output list AFTER it is popped from the stack
- *Reverse Post-Order*, (*Topological Sort)*, returns the output lists that is exactly the reverse of the postorder list.
