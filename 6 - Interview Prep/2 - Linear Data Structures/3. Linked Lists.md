# Linked Lists

## Linked Lists: Conceptual

### Introduction

A linked list is a basic data structure that serves as a foundation for other more complex data structures.

A linked list is a series of nodes containing data and a link to the next node in the list.

Since links are used, the list doesn’t need to be sequentially stored in memory and insertion and removal of nodes is quicker.

Common operations:

- adding nodes
- removing nodes
- finding a node
- Traversing the list

A linked list is typically *unidirectional*, but some use *bidirectional* links, meaning that the node would contain a next and a previous node.

This first node in a linked list is called the head node.

### Linked Lists Adding and Removing Nodes

- Adding a new node

To add to the beginning of a list, you will link your node to the current head node, meaning that it  becomes the current head node.

- Removing a node

Removing a node from the middle of a list will create an orphaned node. Adjust the link on the previous node to point to the following node.

## Linked Lists: JavaScript

Here’s an example of a Linked List class:

```javascript
const Node = require('./Node');

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }
  
  addToHead(data) {
    const newHead = new Node(data);
    const currentHead = this.head;
    this.head = newHead;
    if (currentHead) this.head.setNextNode(currentHead);
  }

  addToTail(data) {
    // Ensure the list is not empty
    let tail = this.head;
    if (!tail) {
      this.head = new Node(data);
    } else {
      // Iterate tail to get to the end of the list
      while(tail.getNextNode() !== null) {
        tail = tail.getNextNode();
      }
      // Set the tail
      tail.setNextNode(new Node(data));
    }
  }

  removeHead() {
    const removedHead = this.head;
    if (!removedHead) return;
    this.head = removedHead.getNextNode();
    return removedHead.data;
  }

  printList() {
    let currentNode = this.head;
    let output = '<head> ';
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      output = output + currentNode.data + ' ';
      currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
    }
    output = output + '<tail>';
    // console.log(output);
    return output; 
  }
}

module.exports = LinkedList;
```

## Swapping Elements in a Linked List

This isn’t as easy in an array where we have access to indecies. To swap data we would need to update the pointers on the two data points as well as the on the nodes the precede the two nodes.

Generally the steps are:

1. Iterate through the linest looking for the node that matches `data1` to be swapped (`node1`) while keeping track of the node’s previous node as you iterate (`node1Prev`) .
2. Repeat step 1 looking for the node that matches `data2` (`node2` and `node2Prev` )
3. If `node1Prev` is `null` , `node1` was the head of the list, so the list's head becomes `node2`
4. Otherwise, set `node1Prev` 's next node to `node2`
5. If `node2Prev` is `null` set the list’s head to `node1`
6. Otherwise, set `node2Prev`' s next node to `node1`
7. Set `node1` 's next node to `node2` 's next node
8. Set `node2` 's next node to `node1` 's next node

We may also have to handle edge cases like the data matching or the elements not being in the list.

```javascript
function swapNodes(list, data1, data2) {
  let node1 = list.head;
  let node2 = list.head;
  let node1Prev = null;
  let node2Prev = null;

  // Handle duplicate data
  if (data1 === data2) {
    console.log('Elements are the same - no swap to be made.');
    return;
  }

  // Step 1
  while(node1 !== null) {
    if (node1.data === data1) {
      break;
    }
    node1Prev = node1;
    node1 = mode1.getNextNode();
  }

  // Step 2
  while(node2 !== null) {
    if (node2.data === data2) {
      break;
    }
    node2Prev = node2;
    node2 = node2.getNextNode();
  }

  // Handle node not found
  if (node1 === null || node2 === null) {
    console.log('Swap not possible, one or more nodes not in the list');
    return;
  }

  // Step 3 & 4
  if (node1Prev === null) {
    list.head = node2;
  } else {
    node1Prev.setNextNode(node2);
  }

  // Step 5 & 6
  if (node2Prev === null) {
    list.head = node1;
  } else {
    node2Prev.setNextNode(node1)
  }

  // Step 7 & 8
  let temp = node1.getNextNode();
  node1.setNextNode(node2.getNextNode());
  node2.setNextNode(temp);
}
```

## Two-Pointer Linked List Techniques

### Two-Pointers Moving in Parallel

Here’s a problem to consider:

Find the nth-to-last item in a singly linked list.

- We need to know how far from the end we are, but we don't have a great way of iterating back through

#### Approaches

- Store a representation of the list in an array so that it can be moved through

```javascript
const arrayNthLast = (list, n) => {
  const linkedListArray = [];
  let currentNode = list.removeHead();
  while(currentNode) {
    linkedListArray.push(currentNode);
    currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
  }
  return linkedListArray[linkedListArray.length - n];
}
```

The memory complexity of this solution is bad becuase we’re storing a duplicate of the entire list

- Use two pointers at different position in the list moving at the same rate, but delayed by `n`

```javascript
const nthLastNode = ( linkedList, n) => {
  let current = null;
  let tailSeeker = linkedList.head;
  let count = 0;
  while (tailSeeker) {
    tailSeeker = tailSeeker.next;
    if (count >= n) {
      if (!current) {
        current = linkedList.head;
      }
      current = current.next;
    }
    count++
  }
  return current;

};
```

### Pointers at Different Speeds

Consider the following problem:

Find the middle node of a linked list.

#### Approach

Use two pointers iterating at different speeds to find the middle.

```javascript
const findMiddle = linkedList => {
  let current = linkedList.head;
  let slowPointer = linkedList.head;

  while (current) {
    current = current.getNextNode();
    if (current) {
      current = current.getNextNode();
      slowPointer = slowPointer.getNextNode();
    }
  }

  return slowPointer;
}
```
