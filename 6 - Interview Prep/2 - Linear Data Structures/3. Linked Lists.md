# Linked Lists

## Linked Lists: Conceptual

### Introduction

A linked list is a basic data structure that serves as a foundation for other more complex data structures.

A linked list is a series of nodes containing data and a link to the next node in the list.

Since links are used, the list doesn’t need to be sequentially stored in memory and insertion and removal of nodes is quicker.

Common operations:

- adding nodes
- removing nodes
- finding a node
- Traversing the list

A linked list is typically *unidirectional*, but some use *bidirectional* links, meaning that the node would contain a next and a previous node.

This first node in a linked list is called the head node.

### Linked Lists Adding and Removing Nodes

- Adding a new node

To add to the beginning of a list, you will link your node to the current head node, meaning that it  becomes the current head node.

- Removing a node

Removing a node from the middle of a list will create an orphaned node. Adjust the link on the previous node to point to the following node.

## Linked Lists: JavaScript

Here’s an example of a Linked List class:

```javascript
const Node = require('./Node');

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }
  
  addToHead(data) {
    const newHead = new Node(data);
    const currentHead = this.head;
    this.head = newHead;
    if (currentHead) this.head.setNextNode(currentHead);
  }

  addToTail(data) {
    // Ensure the list is not empty
    let tail = this.head;
    if (!tail) {
      this.head = new Node(data);
    } else {
      // Iterate tail to get to the end of the list
      while(tail.getNextNode() !== null) {
        tail = tail.getNextNode();
      }
      // Set the tail
      tail.setNextNode(new Node(data));
    }
  }

  removeHead() {
    const removedHead = this.head;
    if (!removedHead) return;
    this.head = removedHead.getNextNode();
    return removedHead.data;
  }

  printList() {
    let currentNode = this.head;
    let output = '<head> ';
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      output = output + currentNode.data + ' ';
      currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
    }
    output = output + '<tail>';
    // console.log(output);
    return output; 
  }
}

module.exports = LinkedList;
```
