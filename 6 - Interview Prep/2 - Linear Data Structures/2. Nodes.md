# Nodes

## Nodes: Coneceptual

### Nodes Introduction

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks on many computer science data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and others.

A **node** contains data and links to other nodes.

### Nodes Detail

Data in a node can be a variety of types, depending on the language you are implementing in.

Links, or *pointers*, will point one node to another. If a node doesn’t ave a link, of the link is null, then you’ve reached the end of the node or link path.

### Node Linking

A node should only be linked *to* by one other node.

If the link to a node is removed, then that data could be lost due to being *orphaned*.

## Nodes: JavaScript

### Introduction: Nodes in JavaScript

Here’s an example of a class that can be created with a data property and a next property that can be set to the node that it links to.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
  
  setNextNode(node) {
    if (node instanceof Node || node === null) {
      this.next = node;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Next node must be a member of the Node class.')
    }
  }

  getNextNode() {
    return this.next;
  }
}

const firstNode = new Node('I am an instance of a Node!');

module.exports = Node;
```

## Using a Node

Using the class above, here’s an example of nodes in use:

```javascript
const Node = require('Node');

// Create three nodes for ice cream flavors
const strawberryNode = new Node('Berry Tasty');
const vanillaNode = new Node('Vanilla');
const coconutNode = new Node('Coconuts for Coconut');

// Set the order of the nodes by declaring their "next" node
vanillaNode.setNextNode(strawberryNode);
strawberryNode.setNextNode(coconutNode);

// Using a "currentNode" variable, loop through the nodes in order
let currentNode = vanillaNode;
while (currentNode !== null) {
  console.log(currentNode.data);
  currentNode = currentNode.next;
}
// Logs:
//   Vanilla
//   Berry Tasty
//   Coconuts for Coconut
```

With a node strucutre we can link data in a logical way. This relationship is one way, always progressing forward.
