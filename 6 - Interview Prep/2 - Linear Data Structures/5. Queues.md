# Queues

A *queue* is a sequential structure of Nodes where nodes are exclusively added to the head and exclusively removed from the tail. In other words, a queue is first-in, first-out. It's like standing in a line!

[ It is possible to also add only to the tail and only remove from the head, so long as the FIFO protocol is maintained. ]

There are three different operations that are helpful in a queue:

- *Enqueue -* the adding to the queue at the head [or tail]
- *Dequeue* - the removal of the tail of the queue [or head]
- *Peek* - To see the head of the queue, or the next in line, without removing that Node

This could be implemented with a *linked list* with the head and the tail maintained, since there are operations on both ends.

You can also create a *bounded queue*, by limiting the number of nodes in the queue. If another node was added to a full bounded queue, then you will have a *queue overflow.*

If a node is attempted to be removed from an empty queue, you will have a *queue underflow*.

## Queues in JavaScript

We will construct a Queue class using the Node and LinkedList classes from earlier in this unit.

```css
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList.js');

class Queue {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.size = 0;
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
  }

  hasRoom() {
    if (this.size < this.maxSize) return true;
    return false;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    if (this.size === 0) return true;
    return false;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    if (this.hasRoom()) {
      this.queue.addToTail(data);
      this.size++;
      console.log(`Added ${data} to queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Queue is full!');
    }
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      const data = this.queue.removeHead();
      this.size--;
      console.log(`Removed ${data} from queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
      return data;  
    } else {
      throw new Error('Queue is empty!');
    }
  }
}
```
