# Why Data Structures?

Data structures and algorithms are what make programs able to run. Itâ€™s important to know how to organize our data in our programs so that algorithms can access the data quickly!

Data structures handle four main functions for us:

- Inputting information - how is the data received?
- Processing information - how is the data manpulated?
- Maintaining information - how is the data organized?
- Retrieving infromation - how is the data accessed later?

## Choosing a Data Structure

You want to choose data structures that are best suited to the information you have and what it will be used for. Ask these questions:

1. What is the purpose of the data?

Do any of your structures have functionality that is suited for it? How do you need to access the data later?

1. Do you want or need control over how memory is set aside to store your data?

You can use *static memroy allocation* which wil manage memory for you, or *dynamic memory allocation* where you will allocate and reallocate memory within the life of the program.

(Python and Javascript manage memory for you)

1. How long will it take different data structures to accomplish various tasks relative to other datastructures?

This is considering the *runtime* of the operation on a data structure.
