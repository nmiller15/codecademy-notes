# Stacks

A stack is an ordered data structure that is similar to a queue, but it adds and removes data from the same end of the list.

This is thought of as Last In, First Out or First In, Last Out (LIFO, or FILO).

The stack is used in real-world computing. You can also think of it as a stack of books. As you stack books, the first book placed will not be removed until all the others have been.

A stack has three primary methods of interaction:

- *push* - add data to the top of the stack
- *pop* - return and remove data from the top of the stack
- *peek* - return data from the top of the stack without removing it

This can also be implemented with a Linked List, because it is more memory efficient than an array.

If you try to push data on a full stack, you will get a *stack overflow*, and if you try to pop an empty stack, you will get a *stack underflow*.

## Stacks in JavaScript

This is an implementation of a Stack class using a LinkedList

```css
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Stack {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.stack = new LinkedList();
    this.size = 0;
    this.maxSize = maxSize
  }

  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.size > 0) {
      return this.stack.head.data;
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }

  push(value) {
    if (this.hasRoom()) {
      this.stack.addToHead(value);
      this.size++;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Stack is full')
    }
  }

  pop() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      const value = this.stack.removeHead();
      this.size--;
      return value;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Stack is empty.')
    }
  }
}

module.exports = Stack
```
