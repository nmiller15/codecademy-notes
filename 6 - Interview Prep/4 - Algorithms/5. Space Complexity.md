# Space Complexity

Big O, or asymptotic notation can be used to measure space complexity, or the amount of memory that a program will need to run in relation to it's input. The space and time complexities of a function will probably not match.

Here's an example of a function that has O(1) space complexity:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

This function, no matter the size of the input, will always use the same space.

Here's another example:

```javascript
function simpleLoop(inputArray) {
  for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

We know that the time complexity for this would by **O(N)**, but the loop doesn't create any new variables, so it is also **O(1)**.

Here's an example of a function that has a space complexity of **O(N)**

```javascript
function doubledArray(inputArray) {
  const doubledArray = [];
  for (let i = 0, i < inputArray.length, i++) {
    doubledArray[i] = inputArray[i] * 2
  }
  return doubledArray
}
```

This is O(N) because the size of the variable that is being created is linearly dependent on the size of the input!

We can actually optimize this function to use less memory than it does, here's how:

```javascript
function doubleInPlace(inputArray) {
  for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length, i++) {
    inputArray[i]*= 2;
  }
  return inputArray
}
```

Now we're back to O(1), the function itself will only use as much space as the input that's given.

It's important that we optimize not only the runtime of programs, but also the space efficiency!
