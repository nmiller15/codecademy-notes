# Quicksort

Quicksort is another divide and conquer algorithm it begins with a partition step, where a *pivot* is chosen and the array is iterated through, separating the values into a "greater than the pivot" array and a "less than the pivot" array.

```plaintext
[6, 5, 2, 1, 9, 3, 8, 7]
6 # the pivot
[5, 2, 1, 3] # lesser than 6
[9, 8, 7] # greater than 6
```

The lesser than values will never be compared with the greater than values, it also doesn’t matter that the subarrays are not ordered, we are going to continue breaking down the array recursively until each sub array has no more than one value.

> **A note on runtime efficiency:**

> The efficiency of this algorithm comes down to the pivot selection. In the above example, we used the first value, but imagine if we did that on an already sorted list, you would wind up with an empty subarray and another subarray with all the values of the original array, effectively wasting a step. So, we want to do what we can to make sure that the pivot is roughly a middle value, so that we can have subarrays of roughly equal size.

> Methods for choosing pivots:

- > Select at random
- > Take the first, middle and last elements and use a median value

> On average the runtime of quicksort is `O(N^2)` , but on average it sits at `O(N log N)` . We typically only refer to the worst cases, but since the worst case is so uncommon in quicksort, it is okay to refer to it as `O(N log N)` .

Once the lists have been divided into one or less elements, then each sub-list is “sorted” because a one-element array is already sorted. Then the sub-lists are recombined, or swaps are made in the original array that produce a sorted list.

## Implementing a Quicksort

```plaintext
If there is more than one element left in the array:
  Find the pivot index through partitioning

  If the left pointer is less than the pivot index:
    Call quicksort() on the portion of the array between the left pointer and the pivot

  If the pivot index is less than the right pointer:
    Call quicksort() on the portion of the array between the pivot index and the right pointer.

Return the sorted array
```

This implementation uses a left and right index to partition the array. After selecting a pivot, the poitners will start on either end, moving toward the middle. They will swap values when each finds a value that is greater/less than the pivot. Once the reach the middle, then we can partition the array and then recurse.

```javascript
const swap = require('./swap');

const quicksort = (array, leftBound = 0, rightBound = array.length - 1) => {
  // Since we are sorting in place and passing the same array
  // array.length will not change, and using it for the base case
  // conditional will lead to a stack overflow
  if (leftBound < rightBound) {
    const pivotIndex = partition(array, leftBound, rightBound)
    quicksort(array, leftBound, pivotIndex - 1)
    quicksort(array, pivotIndex, rightBound);
  }
  return array;
}

const partition = (array, leftIndex, rightIndex) => {
  // Find the middle of the array and use the value as the pivot
  const pivot = array[Math.floor((leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2)];
  // using leftIndex and rightIndex, find values on the wrong side of the array
  while (leftIndex <= rightIndex) {
    // Stop the left index on a value greater than the pivot
    while (array[leftIndex] < pivot) {
      leftIndex++;
    }
    // Stop the right index on a value less than the pivot
    while (array[rightIndex] > pivot) {
      rightIndex--;
    }
    // Swap the violating elements if the leftIndex is still less than or equal to the right Index
    if (leftIndex <= rightIndex) {
      swap(array, leftIndex, rightIndex);
      leftIndex++;
      rightIndex--;
    }
  }
  // return leftIndex so that it can be used to split the array
  return leftIndex;
}

module.exports = {
  partition,
  quicksort
};
```
