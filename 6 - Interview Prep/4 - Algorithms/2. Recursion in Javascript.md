# Recursion in JavaScript

Recursive functions can almost always be implemented using an iterative approach as well, but recursive functions tend to result in less code and more readable functions. However, they do add more overhead in terms of function executions.

## Finding Factorials

```javascript
// Iteratively
const iterativeFactorial = (n) => {
  let result = 1;
  while (n > 0) {
    result *= n;
    n -= 1;
  }
  return result
}
```

```javascript
// Recursively
const recursiveFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (n > 0) {
    console.log(`Execusion context: ${n}`)
    return n * recursiveFactorial(n - 1)
  }
}
```

Here’s what’s happening in the recurisive version:

```plaintext
Imagine we call recursiveFactorial(3):

1. recursiveFactorial is called with n = 3
   .. cannot finish execution due to recursiveFactorial call
   ... call stack
   |                |
   |                |
   |                |
   | rF(3)          |

2. recursiveFactorial is called with n - 1 .. or 2
   .. cannot finish execution due to recursiveFactorial call
   ... call stack
   |                |
   |                |
   | rF(2)          |
   | rF(3)          |

3. recursiveFactorial is called with n - 1 .. now 1
   .. cannot finish execution due to recursiveFactorial call
   ... call stack
   |                |
   | rF(1)          |
   | rF(2)          |
   | rF(3)          |

4. recursiveFactorial is called with n - 1 .. now 0
   .. returns zero (base case)
   ... call stack
   | rF(0)          | => 1
   | rF(1)          |
   | rF(2)          |
   | rF(3)          |

5. rF(0) is popped from the stack
   .. rF(1) completes execution, returns 1
   ... call stack
         |                | => 1
   1 =>  | rF(1)          | => 1
         | rF(2)          | 
         | rF(3)          |

6. rF(1) is popped from the stack
   .. rF(2) completes execution, returns 2
   ... call stack
         |                | => 1
   1 =>  |                | => 1
   1 =>  | rF(2)          | => 2
         | rF(3)          |

7. rF(2) is popped from the stack
   .. rF(3) completes execution, returns 6
   ... call stack
         |                | => 1
   1 =>  |                | => 1
   1 =>  |                | => 2
   2 =>  | rF(3)          | => 6

8. rF(3) is popped from the stack
   .. recursion complete
   ... call stack
         |                | => 1
   1 =>  |                | => 1
   1 =>  |                | => 2
   2 =>  |                | * Result => 6
```
