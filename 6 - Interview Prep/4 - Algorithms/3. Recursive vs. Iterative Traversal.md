# Recursive vs. Iterative Traversal

We’ve already traversed a list to find matching data using iterations. It looks like this:

```javascript
class LinkedList {
  ...
  findNodeIteratively (data) {
    let currentNode = this.head
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      if (currentNode.data === data) {
        return currentNode
      }
      currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode()
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

In order to traverse using recursion, we will need another argument `currentNode`, but we can set it with a default of `this.head` so that we don't have to manually call it.

```javascript
class LinkedList {
  ...
  findNodeRecursively (data, currentNode = this.head) {
    // This is the base case, when we have reached the end of the list
    if (currentNode === null) {
      return null
    // This case is called when we've found our node
    } else if (currentNode.data === data) {
      return currentNode
    // The recursive step, calls the function again, but with the next node
    } else {
      return this.findNodeRecursively(data, currentNode.getNextNode())
    }
  }
}
```

## How does this work?

Here’s an example of the steps the callstack would go through for the following situation. Given the `findNodeRecursively` function, and the rest of the class built out for `LinkedList` and `Node` , here's an example of a list called `myList`

```javascript
myList.addToHead('Node 1');
myList.addToHead('Node 2');
myList.addToHead('Node 3');
myList.addToHead('Node 4');


const myNodeRecursive = myList.findNodeRecursively('Node 2');
```

Imagine we need to find the node with the data `”Node 2”` .

```plaintext
1. findNodeRecursively is called with 'Node 2' and this.head
  .. cannot finish execution due to recursion
  ... call stack
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  | fNR('Node 2', this.head)              |

2. findNodeRecursively is called with same data and the next node
  .. cannot finish execution due to recursion
  ... call stack
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  | fNR('Node 2', [next node])            |
  | fNR('Node 2', this.head)              |

3. findNodeRecursively is called with the same data and the next node
  .. this call finds a match and returns matching node
  ... call stack
  |                                       |
  | fNR('Node 2', [next]) *match*         | => matchingNode
  | fNR('Node 2', [next node])            |
  | fNR('Node 2', this.head)              |

4. Top of the stack is popped and next function can evaluate ..
  .. the matchingNode is returned by the next function in the stack
  ... call stack
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  | fNR('Node 2', [next node])            | => matchingNode
  | fNR('Node 2', this.head)              |

  .. the same happens again to return the result
  ... call stack
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  | fNR('Node 2', this.head)              | => matchingNode

5. Call stack is cleared 
  ... call stac
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  |                                       |
  |                                       | => matchingNode
```
