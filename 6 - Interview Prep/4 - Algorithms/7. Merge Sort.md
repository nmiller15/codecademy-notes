# Merge Sort

Merge sorting is also called *divide and conquer*, it’s the practice of dividing the list down into smaller and smaller elements until sorting them becomes simple.

Merge sorting has two phases: 1) split the data into “runs”, and 2) recombine the runs into sorted lists, the “merge”.

For our merge, we will divide our sort in half, and then recursively call the sort on each half, continuing the process until all the lists have only one element, at which point, we merge again.

When we merge two single-element lists, we check if the first element is begger than the other then we return the sub-list with the smaller element follwed by the larger one.

When we recombine the lists, we will do comparisons of each list, one index at a time.

Merge sort is interesting, because it’s best, worst and average time complexities are all the same

O(N log N)

So it doesn’t matter how sorted the input is, it will always be the same. It’s disadvantage is that it requres a lot of space, since the input is being split into so many sub-lists.

## Implementing Merge Sort in JavaScript

```plaintext
function merge(leftArray, rightArray)
  sortedArray = [];
  while leftArray and rightArray have a length greater than 0
    add the smaller of first indecies to the sortedArray
    pop the value added to the sortedArray
  return sortedArray with leftArray and rightArray concatenated

function mergeSort(arr)
  if the length of arr equals 1
    return arr

  midIndex = the floor integer of (left + right) / 2
  leftArr = arr from 0 to midIndex
  rightArr = arr from midIndex to end

  return merge( mergeSort(leftArray), mergeSort(rightArray))
```

```javascript
const merge = (leftArray, rightArray) => {
  const sortedArray = [];
  while (leftArray.length > 0 && rightArray.length > 0) {
    if (leftArray[0] < rightArray[0]) {
      sortedArray.push(leftArray[0])
      leftArray.shift();
    } else {
      sortedArray.push(rightArray[0]);
      rightArray.shift();
    }
  }
  return sortedArray.concat(leftArray).concat(rightArray)
}

const mergeSort = (startArray) => {
  const length = startArray.length
  if (length === 1) {
    return startArray;
  }

  const mid = Math.floor(length / 2);
  const leftArray = startArray.slice(0, mid);
  const rightArray = startArray.slice(mid, length);

  mergeSort(leftArray);
  mergeSort(rightArray);
}
```
