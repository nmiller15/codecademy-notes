# Bubble Sort

## What is a Bubble Sort?

A bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that works by checking the values of adjacent indecies and switching them if they do not follow the constraint. We implement this using a nested loop, the outermost runs while the array is unsorted, and the inner one works through the array, check in the values at indexes.

```plaintext
Function BubbleSortAscending (array)
  While array is unsorted
    for each value in array - 1
      if current value > next value
        swap current and next value
  return array
```

```javascript
function bubbleSortAscending(array) {
  let swap = true;
  while (swap) {
    swap = false;
    let i = 0;
    while (i + 1 < array.length) {
      if (array[i] > array[i+1]) {
        [array[i], array[i+1]] = [array[i+1], array[i]]
        swap = true;
      }
      i++;
    }
  }
  return array;
}
```

## Swapping Variables

We can’t directly assign the values to one another without a temporary variable. JavaScript allows for multiple assignment, which is what was implemented above in the swap, however, if this is not an option, the following solution will also suffice:

```javascript
let temp = array[i];
array[i] = array[i+1];
array[i+1] = temp;
```

## Alogrithm Analysis

Since we have two loops, we need to know what the efficiency is of both of them to analyze what the total efficiency is.

The outer loop will run `N` times, if the hightest value is at the beginning, it will require at least N swaps to move it all the way to the back.

The inner loop will always run `N-1` times.

We can log and reduce this efficiency as:

$$
O(n(n-1)) = O(n(n)) = o(n^2)
$$

So this algorithm’s big O is O(n^2), it is quadratic.
