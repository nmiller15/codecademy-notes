# Trees

A tree is a data structure that is used to store hierarchically-strucutred data. It is built using a tree node, a variation on the node that has been used in the previous structures.

The flow of data in a tree is downward from the *root* or the top of the tree. Nodes in this structure store data and references to zero or more *other tree nodes*.

The root of the tree will reference itâ€™s *children*, nodes that are further down the tree than itself. The children of root refer to it as it's *parent* and each other as *siblings*. When a node has no children, it is called a *leaf* node.

Tree structure allows for wide, and deep data models, but **each node will only ever have one parent.**

When we move from parent to child, we are moving down a *level*. When we go deeper into the tree, this movement is called *depth*, when we ascend, this movement is called *height*.

## Why a Tree?

First, they are good at showing hirearchy, but more than that, we can place further constraints on the data structure to make search more efficient.

A *binary tree*, is a tree where each parent can have no more than two children, a *left child* and a *right child*. With additional constraints we can create a *binary search tree*:

- Left child values must be lesser than their parent
- Right child values must be greater than thier parent

This allows us to discard half of the results each time we search.

## Implementing a Tree in JavaScript

### The TreeNode

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child))
    }
  }

  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const numOfChildren = this.children.length
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      if (childToRemove instanceof TreeNode) {
        return child !== childToRemove
      } else {
        return child.data !== childToRemove
      }
    })
    if (numOfChildren === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => {
        child.removeChild(childToRemove);
      })
    }
  }

  print(level = 0) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {
      result += '-- ';
    }
    console.log(`${result}${this.data}`);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.print(level + 1));
  }

  // See all of the tree nodes from top to bottom
  depthFirstTraversal() {
    console.log(this.data);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.depthFirstTraversal());
  }

  // See each child of each children array -- side to side
  breadthFirstTraversal() {
    let queue = [this]; 
    while(queue.length !== 0) {
      const current = queue.shift();
      console.log(current.data);
      queue = queue.concat(current.children);
    }
  }
};

module.exports = TreeNode
```
