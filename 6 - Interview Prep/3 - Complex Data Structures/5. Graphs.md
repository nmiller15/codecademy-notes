# Graphs

## Conceptual

A graph is a data structure that specializes in storing networks, or maps. It is comprised of nodes, called *vertices*, that store the data and *edges*. An edge is the connection between two vertices.

If you think of a bus route map as a graph, each stop would be a vertex, and each of the paths between the vertexes would be edges.

### Graph Connections

Graphs can have varying levels of connection. When we look at the relationships of vertices, we can describe two vertices as *adjacent* when they are directly connected by an edge. There are also relationships between vertices that are not directly connected, if there is a connection between two vertices, no matter how many vertices it must go through, we call this a *path*. If there is no connection between two vertices, we call them *disconnected*.

### Weighted Graphs

In a *weighted graph* we will assign values to the edges. We call this value a *cost.* Imagine it like a toll road, not all roads cost the same to travel across, and that value, we would be associated with the road, or the edge. If we tally the cost of each edge used to get from one vertex to the end of our path, we can calculate the *total cost* of the path. Using this, it's important to keep in mind that the shortest path is not always the least expensive.

### Directed Graphs

In *directed graphs*, we will enforce the directions of the edges. This means that they are only single-direction. In graphs that are not directed, we can move bi-directionally. In a directional graph, if you can reach the original vertex through a path, this is called a *cycle*.

### Graph Representation

There are two main ways that we will represent graphs, through an *adjacency matrix* and through an *adjacency list.*

#### Adjacency Matrix

In an *adjacency matrix*, we will map all of the vertices on the x and y axes of a graph. Then in the corresponding squares will will make whether or not there is an edge using 1s and 0s.

#### Adjacency List

In an *adjacency list*, each vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertexes. If you want to find one, you need only search the appropriate list.

## Graphs in JavaScript

We will build three classes to represent graphs in JavaScript `Vertex` `Edge` and `Graph`

### Vertex.js

```javascript
const Edge = require('./Edge.js');

class Vertex {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.edges = []
  }

  addEdge(vertex, weight) {
    if (vertex instanceof Vertex) {
      const newEdge = new Edge(this, vertex, weight);
      this.edges.push(newEdge);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Must create an edge between two Vertices.')
    }
  }

  removeEdge(vertexToRemove) {
    if (vertexToRemove instanceof Vertex) {
      const newEdges = this.edges.filter(edge => edge.end !== vertexToRemove);
      this.edges = newEdges;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Removal argument must be a Vertex.')
    }
  }
  
  print() {
    const edgeList = this.edges.map(edge =>
        edge.weight !== null ? `${edge.end.data} (${edge.weight})` : edge.end.data) || [];

    const output = `${this.data} --> ${edgeList.join(', ')}`;
    console.log(output);
  }
}

module.exports = Vertex;
```

### Graph.js

```javascript
const Edge = require('./Edge.js');
const Vertex = require('./Vertex.js');

class Graph {
  constructor(isWeighted = false, isDirected = false) {
    this.vertices = [];
    this.isWeighted = isWeighted;
    this.isDirected = isDirected;
  }

  addVertex(data) {
    const newVertex = new Vertex(data);
    this.vertices.push(newVertex);
    return newVertex;
  }

  removeVertex(vertexToRemove) {
    const filteredVertices = this.vertices.filter(vertex => vertex !== vertexToRemove);
    this.vertices = filteredVertices;
  }

  addEdge(vertex1, vertex2, weight) {
    const edgeWeight = this.isWeighted ? weight : null;
    if (vertex1 instanceof Vertex && vertex2 instanceof Vertex) {
      vertex1.addEdge(vertex2, edgeWeight);
      if (!this.isDirected) vertex2.addEdge(vertex1, edgeWeight);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Cannot create an edge unless both arguments are vertices.')
    }
  }

  removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    if (vertex1 instanceof Vertex && vertex2 instanceof Vertex) {
      vertex1.removeEdge(vertex2);
      if (!this.isDirected) vertex2.removeEdge(vertex1);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Cannot remove an edge unless both arguments are vertices.')
    }
  }
    
  print() {
    const vertexList = this.vertices || [];
    vertexList.forEach(vertex => vertex.print());
  }
}

module.exports = Graph;
```

### Edge.js

```javascript
class Edge {
  constructor(start, end, weight = null) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
    this.weight = weight;
  }
}

module.exports = Edge;
```

### Using these Classes Together

We are attempting to make all of the operations available to the `Graph` class, so that the creation of vertices and their connection with edges can all be done through this class. This way we are abstracting away from the `Vertex` and `Edge` methods so that users don't have to intimately understand our graph implementation to use it.

#### Adding Edges

For example, to add an edge we will use the `Graph` class's `addEdge` method, even though the vertex has an `addEdge` method as well. We will be calling the Vertex `addEdge` method within the `graph` so that all of the methods are in the same place.
