# Heaps

A heap is a modified tree structure, specifically a *binary tree*, that specializes in quickly accessing the maximum or minimum values of the structure (a max-heap or min-heap respectively).

A heap may be used to keep track the highest and lowest numbers, or even task priority. In a *priority queue*, for instance, a heap is generally used to keep track of the priority of the tasks.

In a min-heap:

- the root is the minimum value of the dataset
- each child's value is greater than or equal to it's parent

In a max-heap:

- the root is the maximum value of the dataset
- each child's value is less than or equal it it's parent

## Heap Representation

A heap can be implemented as a tree, a *binary tree* specifically. In this structure, we will add only two parents to each child and we will start at the leftmost breadth of the level and move right as we add to the tree.

For efficiency, a heap can also be implemented using a sequential data structure like an array or a list.

In a tree representation, you could locate the indexes of related nodes using the following formulas:

- left child - `(index * 2) + 1`
- right child - `(index * 2) + 2`
- parent - `(index - 1) / 2`

## Heapifying

Sometimes we will add values to the heap that do not satisfy the structure of the heap. Imagine adding a 3 in a min-heap as the left child of 11. This does not work because three is not greater than or equal to the parent.

In this case, we will have to *heapify up*, a process where we compare a parent to a child and swap them to satisfy the conditions until the condition is satisfied or we run out of parents. If we run out of parents, then the addition is the new root!

When we want to retrieve the minimum value, (or maximum), we cannot just orphan two nodes. So to handle this, we will swap the bottom right node with the root, replacing it. Then we *heapify down*. This is similar to heapinfying up. We compare the children of the node, replacing it with the smaller of the two. We continue iterating this way so that the smallest value remaining is now the root again and the bottom right node has traversed to the end again.

In short:

- heapifying down - when a child violates the heap structure, the parent is swaped down with the child
- heapifying up - when a parent violates the head structure the child is swapped up

## Implementing a Heap in JavaScript

Min-Heap

Note that this will be implemented with an array, but the array is still modeling a binary tree! We will use the above arithmetic to create methods to retrieve relationships in the structure

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [null];
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(value) {
    this.heap.push(value); // Add value to the end of the heap
    this.size++;
    this.bubbleUp(); // Preserve heap properties
  }

  popMin() {
    if (!this.size) return null;
    /* optional logging */ console.log(`.. swapping ${this.heap[1]} and ${this.heap[this.size]}`)
    this.swap(1, this.size);
    const min = this.heap.pop();
    /* optional logging */ console.log(`Removed minimum value: ${min}`)
    this.size--;
    this.heapify();
    return min;
  }

  heapify() {
    let current = 1
    let leftChild = getLeft(current);
    let rightChild = getRight(current);
    while (this.canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild)) {
      if (this.exists(leftChild) && this.exists(rightChild)) {
        if (this.heap[leftChild] < this.heap[rightChild]) {
          this.swap(leftChild, current);
          current = leftChild;
        } else {
          this.swap(rightChild, current);
          current = rightChild;
        }
      } else {
        this.swap(leftChild, current);
        current = leftChild;
      }
      leftChild = getLeft(current);
      rightChild = getRight(current);
    }
  }

  bubbleUp() {
    let current = this.size;
    while (current > 1 && this.heap[current] < this.heap[getParent(current)]) {
      /* optional logging */ console.log(`Swapping ${this.heap[current]} & ${this.heap[getParent(current)]}.`)
      this.swap(current, getParent(current));
      /* optional logging */ console.log(this.heap);
      current = getParent(current);
    }
  }

  swap(a, b) {
    [this.heap[a], this.heap[b]] = [this.heap[b], this.heap[a]];
  }

  exists(index) {
    return index <= this.size;
  }

  canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild) {
    // Check that one of the possible swap conditions exists
    return (
      this.exists(leftChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[leftChild]
      || this.exists(rightChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[rightChild]
    );
  }
}

// Give an index to these helper functions to return the related index
const getParent = current => Math.floor((current / 2));
const getLeft = current => current * 2;
const getRight = current => current * 2 + 1;

module.exports = MinHeap;
```
