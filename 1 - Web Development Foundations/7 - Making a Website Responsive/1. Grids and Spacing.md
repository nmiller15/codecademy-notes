# Grids and Spacing

### Grid Types

- We will use *grid* for design work
- There are *block grids* and *column grids*
- Most web design is in a column grid.

### Grid Anatomy

- Three major components of a grid:
- *column, gutter, margin*

### Grid Columns

- You can have content that spans into other columns, or you can stay consistent throughtout the rest of the site. But, unless the content is continuing into the next column, you cannot have any content skip into a gutter.

### Grid Rows

- Rows are the horizontal organization.
- Rows are used to group content together and to re-order for more white space.

### Whitespace
