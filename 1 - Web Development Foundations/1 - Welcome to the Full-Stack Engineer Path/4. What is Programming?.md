# What is Programming?

- giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute
- **Programming** is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
- **Coding** is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

> *"The problem with programming is not that the computer isn't logical--the computer is terribly logical, relentlessly literal-minded.*”

> El Ullman, *Life in Code*
