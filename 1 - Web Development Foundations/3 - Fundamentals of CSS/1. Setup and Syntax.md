- **Ruleset Terms**
   - **selector** - beginning of the ruleset, selects the element that will will be targeted to style
   - **declaration block** - the code in-between and including the curly braces { } that contains declarations
   - **declaration** - the group name for a property and value pair that applies style
   - **property** - first part of a declaration that decides what visual characteristic is being modified
   - **value** - the second part of the declaration that says how the property will be modified
- **Inline Style Terms:**
   - **opening tag** - the start of the html element
   - **attribute** - the STYLE attribute is used to add inline style
   - **declaration** - same
   - **property** - same
   - **value** - same

### Inline Styles

- The **style** attribute allows you to add CSS directly into HTML.
- You can add more than one style in the style attribute, just separate each style with a semi-colon (;) (this also has to terminate the final declaration.
- You will rarely use this in creating a website. They are quick but there are times where it may be necessary.

### Internal Stylesheet

- An **internal stylesheet** is a stylesheet that exists in the same document in a STYLE element nested in a HEAD element.
- This is still not best practice, but it does function similarly to having a separate stylesheet.
- It also has some specific use-casesâ€¦ but not typical.

### External Stylesheet

- BEST PRACTICE
- Having a separate document **avoids mixing code** and adheres to **separation of concerns**.
- A CSS file will have the extension .css
   - `style.css`

### Linking the CSS File

- An HTML file needs to be told to look for styling in another file.
- **<link>** - a self-closing tag that requires an href and rel attribute that will *link* a CSS file to the HTML doc
   - href - the path of the file to be linked
   - rel - describes the relationship of the linked document to the HTML doc. in the case of a CSS doc, the value will be **stylesheet**

```html
<link href='https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css' 
  rel='stylesheet'>
```

- You can use a full URL as the path to the style sheet, but if it is stored in the same [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) as the HTML file you can use a relative path.

```html
<link href='./style.css' rel='stylesheet'>
```
