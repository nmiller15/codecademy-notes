# Visual Rules

### Font-Family

- When you set a `font-family`:
   - the font must be installed on a user’s computer or transmitted with the site
      - [Web safe fonts](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) are generally supported everywhere
   - When a font has more than one word, enclose it in quotes:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: 'Courier New'
}
```

### Font Weight

- `font-weight` takes two values
   - `bold`
   - `normal` (this exists to override a bold font weight at a lower specificity)

### Text Align

- `text-align` will align an element **to its parent element** and takes the values
   - `left`
   - `center`
   - `right`
   - `justify`

### Color and Background Color

- **foreground color** - the color than an element appears in
   - `color`
- **background color** - the color of the space surrounding the visual pieces of the element
   - `background-color`

### Opacity

- The transparency of an object measured from 0 to 1 with
   - 0 being not visible and
   - 1 being fully visible

```css
.overlay {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Background Image

- Like `background-color` but uses an image instead.
- Syntax is

```css
.main-banner {
  background-image: url('#');
}
```

- You can use [relative path ](https://docs.craft.do/editor/d/b4ae036d-e2e6-fd10-7e5e-f12ec518b2e1/6167C817-92B5-4FB5-ABA0-BA695D74D6A2/x/D09A7864-72A4-4591-B43E-2F8CE19C1953)to call an image, you will still use the value: `url(‘#’);`

### Important

- `!important` can be applied to declarations individually rather than the full ruleset
- Use very sparingly. `!important` overrides *any* specificity.
- Syntax is

```css
p {
  color: blue !important;
}

.main p {
  color: red;
}
```

   - In this, the blue will override the red, even though `p` is less specific than `.main p`
   - You would never code this example… you wasted keystokes on the `.main p` ruleset
- You might use `!important` if you were using multiple stylesheets and wanted to override it for one element.
