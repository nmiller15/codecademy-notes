# Changing the Box Model

### Why Change the Box Model?

Take a look at this code:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

You would think that the height and width of `<h1>` are 200px and 300px respectively right? Wrong.

The width is actually 322px and the height is 222px. This is because the padding and the border content is *added* to the values that were set with `height` and `width`. Remember, these are *content* height and width.

This makes things kinda hard to position on a webpage.

### Box Model: Content-Box

There is a property in CSS that hasnâ€™t been covered yet, and it has a default value that causes us to use the box model.

- `box-sizing: content-box` - default
- This is the property value that we have been working in.

### Box Model: Border-Box

Another value for this is `border-box`. This effectively changes the use case for the `height` and `width` properties to fix the box to their set values. Any `padding` or `border` will be *subtracted* from the `height` and `width` instead. Everything stays INSIDE!

```css
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1 {
  border: 1px dashed #4f768e;
  height: 150px;
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Now, as is more naturally expected, the box is only 150px high and 200px wide. The *content* *size* will be adjusted automatically to 109px high and 159px wide.
