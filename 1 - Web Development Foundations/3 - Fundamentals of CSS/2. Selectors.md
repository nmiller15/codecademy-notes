# Selectors

### Type

- **selectors** - decide what elements get the style from the sheet.
- A **type** selector matches the *type* of element in the HTML document

| **HTML Element** | **CSS Type Selector** |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| <p>              | p                     |
| <h1>             | h1                    |
| <div>            | div                   |

- type selector is often called the **tag name** or **element** selector

### Universal

- The **universal** selector selects *all* elements of *any* type.
- This will essentially reset the defailt browser styling, or you can use it to select all the children of a parent element.
- * is the universal selector

```css
* { 
  font-family: Verdana;
}
```

### Class

- HTML elements can also be styled by targeting their *attributes**.***
- The **class** attribute is one of the most common ways to style an element.
- class can be set equal to any string, so make it meaningful to make it easier to read.
- To target a class value you must type a period [ . ] followed by the value of the class.

```html
<p class="targetThis">Test</p>
```

```css
.targetThis {
  font-size: 48px;
}
```

### Multiple Classes

- We can separate style information into different classes beause HTML elements can recieve multiple values for the class attribute. Here's an example for why that's helpful:

```css
.green {
  color: green;
}
.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

   And the syntax in HTML for assigning both of these classes is:

```html
<h1 class='green bold'> ... </h1>
```

   This means that we don’t need custom classes for absolutely every combination we need. We can mix and match to create unique styles.

### ID

- Sometimes we need unique style applied. For this, we will give the HTML object an id attribute.
- id can only have a **single value** and that value can **only be used once** on a page.
- We target id’s in CSS with a # (hash)

```html
<h1 id="unique-id"> ... </h1>
```

```css
#unique-id {
  text-transform: uppercase
}
```

### Attribute

- An **attribute selector** can be used to target any HTML element that contains that attribute (meaning attributes that aren't class or id)
- Here’s the syntax

```css
[href] {
  color: magenta;
}
```

- You can also bet more granular, or specific by adding type and/or attribute values.

   `type[attribute*=value]`

```html
<img src="./images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg"/>
<img src="./images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg"/>
```

```css
img[src*='winter'] {
  height: 50px;
}
```

   Looks for an `<img>` that has a `src` that contains the string `‘winter’`

```css
img[src*='summer'] {
  height: 100px;
}
```

   Looks for an `<img>` that has a `src` that contains the string `‘summer’`.

   This means that we don’t need to add another class or id, we can just target the attribute itself.

### Psuedo-class

- Browsers will change styling based on user interactions. i.e. blue highlights around something in focus, links that change color once clicked, greyed out buttons that are disabled. These are all enabled by pseudo-class selectors.
- **pseudo-class selectors** - select any target and only applys the styling when the user interacts with in the chosen way
   - `:focus` - selected and interacting with
   - `:visited` - already clicked on
   - `:disabled` - not actionable
- Pseudo classes can be added to *any* selector.

```css
p:hover {
  background-color: lime;
}
```

### Classes and IDs

CSS Best Practice Rule:

   - Create classes to be used again!
   - IDs can and will only be used once.
- Think more broadly when using classes, instead of `.bold-blue` make a `.bold` and a `.blue` so that they can be combined and used in different situations.
- IDs should be used sparingly because they *override* class and type styling

### Specificity

- **specificity** - The order in which the browser will read and apply the styling. A *type* is the least specific and the *id* is most specific.
- CSS Best Practice Rule:
   - Style in the *least* specific way possible. Start at the type, and if you need more specificity, add a class or multiple classes. If you still need it to be more granular, consider then using an id.

### Chaining

- You can require an HTML element to fulfill two or more selection requirements to style this is called **chaining**.
- I want to target *only* H1s with the `special` class:

```css
h1.special {
  
}
```

   I basically just shove them together.

### Descendant Combinator

- **descendant** - elements that are nested within other HTML elements. (another name for children)
- **descendant combinator** - a combination of selectors. The browser will search for all of the first selector, and then look in its descendants for the second selector

```html
<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
```

```css
.main-list li {
  ...
}
```

`.main-list` selects an element with the `main-list` class and selects any descendent `<li>`s.

- This can **increase** the specificity of the selector
   - `li {` - least specific
   - `.main-list`
   - `.main-list li {` - most specific
- This is different from chaining in that the elements that are being targeted **do not have** the class being targeted! One of their parents does!!

### Chaining and Specificity

- Adding more than one tag, class or id to a CSS sleector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.

### Multiple Selectors

- We can make CSS more concise if the same style is being added to two different selectors using a comma `,`
- For example, instead of writing

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

.menu {
  font-family: Georgia;
}
```

   we can write

```css
h1,
.menu {
  font-family: Georgia
}
```
