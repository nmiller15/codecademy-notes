# HTML Tables

### Introduction to Tables

- **<table>** presents information in a two-dimensional table to users.

```html
<!--Example table-->
<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Not the Company Name</th>
        <th>Number of Items to Ship</th>
        <th>Next Action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Adam's Greenworks</th>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>Package Items</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Davie's Burgers</th>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Send Invoice</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Baker's Bike Shop</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Send Invoice</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Miss Sally's Southern</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Ship</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Summit Resort Rentals</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Ship</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Strike Fitness</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Enter Order</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>
```

### Create a Table

- **<table></table>** sets up the space for us to build the table

### Table Rows

- Rows, columns and cells are not already created in HTML, we must create them ourselves.
- To create a row we use the **table row** element **<tr></tr>.**
- What is a cell? — a grouping inthe table whiche will contain either *heading labels* or *information* pertaining to the associated row and column headings. These will be covered next…

### Table Data

- Just a row isn't enough to add data, we need to create cells.
- You can add data to the table using the **table data** element **<td></td>**
- Tables are built in rows, the columns are added then in a line across based on the order of data points.

### Table Headings

- The first row and column of most tables defines the data that is seen. We tell browsers that this information is different using the **table heading** element **<th></th>**
- These are used in exactly the same way as a <td> element, they just communicate that the information is a heading rather than data.

```html
<table>
  <tr> <!--Row 1-->
    <th></th><!--This is an empty cell, to make room for the column of headers-->
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <!--The scope atribute defines whether the heading is fora row or a column.
        As far as i can tell, this doesn't have functionality beyond telling the
        browser what it's looking at. I could be wrong though... -->
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Row 2-->
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

- <th> can take the attribute **scope** with the values of **"col"** or **"row"** to define what the heading is for.
   - `<th scope=“col”></th>`
   - `<th scope=“row”></th>`
   - scope can also receive the following attributes
      - rowgroup: for table headings that group rows
      - colgroup
      - auto: the default value —
- Does it actually matter to have a scope??
   - “At the core of standards and guidelines is well-formedness, a term that every serious web developer knows very well. They treat their HTML creations like the work of art they are. All manner of expert knowledge is applied to the creation of a well formed web document. Standards and Accessibility Guidelines are there to help us all reach that height.   //  scope is an attribute that has a specific purpose… To paint the target so the user agent doesn’t have to rely upon any of its own assumptions. Scope gives a row or column group meaning. However indistinct and unrelated the data may be, they have that one thing in common. The same TH.”

### Table Borders

- Borders used to be added by attribute with a value that defined border thickness:
   - `<table border=“1”>`
   - This is now consisdered **depricated**. Meaning that it is not reccommended. DO NOT DO IT. **separation of concerns**
   - You may see this in older code, however.
- Borders are just what they sound like. The line around the cells.
- CSS is used to add borders to cells now since it is *styling*.

### Spanning Columns

- Data sometimes will span multiple columns - think an event in a calendar that is multiple hours.
- **Table data** can receive an attribute called **colspan** that will accept an integer (one or higher) that will tell how many columns it spans.
- `<td colspan=“2”>Data that is two columns wide</td>`
- The colspan attribute can also be used with table headings, but we should also change the scope of the heading using scope=“colgroup”
   - `<th scope=“colgroup” colspan=“2”></th>`

### Spanning Rows

- Similar to above, you can have items span rows using the **rowspan** attribute, which also accepts a nonzero positive integer.
- This is more confusting than spanning columns because you are spanning into the rows below. You must be mindful of this when you are constructing the following rows.

```html
<table>
  <tr> <!-- Row 1 -->
    <th></th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 2 -->
    <th>Morning</th>
    <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
    <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 3 -->
    <th>Afternoon</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!-- Row 4 -->
    <th>Evening</th>
    <td>Dinner</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

1. > The first row contains an empty cell and the two column headings.
2. > The second row contains the Morning row heading, along with Work, which spans two rows under the Saturday column. The “Relax” entry spans three rows under the Sunday column.
3. > The third row only contains the Afternoon row heading.
4. > The fourth row only contains the Dinner entry, since “Relax” spans into the cell next to it.
- When you span data across rows, the data in the following rows will still display if its in, but it skips the span and aligns with others.

### Table Body

- The **table body** element **<tbody>** can section a table off. It should contain all the data in the table besides the table headings.

### Table Head

- We can section off the column headings with the **table head** element **<thead>**
- Even though **<th>** and **scope** can both be used as column *and* row headings, **<thead>** is only used for column headings.

### Table Footer

- We can also section off the bottom part of a table with a **table footer** element **<tfoot>**. Imagine a table with totals at the bottom for a use case.

### Styling with CSS

- By default, tables have no borders and the font color is black.
