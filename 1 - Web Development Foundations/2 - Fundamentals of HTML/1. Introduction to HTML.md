# Introduction to HTML

- A **markup** language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
- **Raw text** is what is wrapped in HTML elements for the computer to read.
- **Hypertext** provides access to other text through links, also known as **hyperlinks**.
- Why do we structure raw text for websites?
   - Allow users to visually scan sites quickly.
   - Help visually impaired users navigate content.
   - Help search engines pick out important keywords that might otherwise get lost in a sea of text.

### HTML Anatomy

- An **element** is comprised of a **tag** which is comprised of an **opening tag**, the **content**, and a **closing tag.**

### The Body

- Only content in the <body> element will be displayed on screen.

### HTML Structure

- When an element is placed **inside** another element that element is considered a **child** of the element that it is inside of. The other cooresponding element is the **parent.**
- Child elements can inherit behavior and styling from the parent element. This is more important in CSS.

### Headings

- <h1> through <h6>

### Divs

- <div> - divides the page into sections to divide the page into sections
- No inherent visual representation, but useful to apply styles
- Divs can contain any HTML elements.
- Add **two spaces** to denote children of elements for better readability.

### Attributes

- Attributes can be added to the opening tag of any element.
- A common attribute is **id**, which can be used to specify different content. It identify it.

```html
<div id="intro">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
```

### Displaying Text

- There are two options to display text
   - <p> - a block of text
   - <span> - contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are *on the same line as other content*.
- <div>s are better for blocks
- <span>s are better for inline

### Styling Text

- There are HTML elements that style text as well.
   - <em> - emphasizes (italic)
   - <strong> - highlights (bold)
- The two tags above must be defined when you are building a web page from scratch.

### Line Breaks

- <br>

### Unordered Lists

### Ordered Lists

### Images

- <img> is a self-closing tag

```html
<img src="image-location.jpg" />
```

### Image Alts

- The **alt** attribute (alternative text), give meaning to the images on the site.
- You can add this just like the source of an image. It should be a description of the image.
- This is important in case a page loads incorrectly, for visually impaired users, and for SEO. Search engines canâ€™t see images, but they can read alt.
- An alt should be left empty if it is not conveying any meaningful information.

### Videos

- <video>
- This is **not** self-closing.

```html
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
```

- width and height set the size of the video.
- controls instructs the browser to include basic video controls on the video.
- The text in between the tags is only displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.
