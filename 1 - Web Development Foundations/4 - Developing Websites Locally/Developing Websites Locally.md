# Getting Started with Visual Studio Code

- A *text editor* is where people will code, it is part of creating a *development environment*
- IDE - an *integrated development environment* allows you to edit, complile and debug your code through one interface

## Building Projects with VS Code

- Before using a text edior, a file sytem must be established.
- Create a new folder, or *directory* for every project that you work on - no matter how small
- Reccomendation is to create one directory for all projects called `projects` and when you have new projects, to add them to this directory.
- index.html - the industry standard name for a website homepage
- “boiler-plate” - the things that HAVE to be in a code type file - what is required for an html file to be read and be well-formatted
- URL - uniform resource locator - it is just a path to a specific file
- **CMD + /** This will comment out lines on VSC
- file extensions will tell the browser or other application how to read the contents of the file
