# Learn Links and Buttons

### Browser Link Styles

- Traditionally, links are blue, but they also have a few other defaults based on state
- Clicked (but not yet followed, appear in read)
- Previously visited links are purple

### Link Styling

- Link style should be significantly different from the surrounding text.
- Anchor text should be descriptive of the linked resourse - this is for usability and SEO

### Tooltips and Tiltes

- You can add a `title` attribute to any element. It will be rendered as a *tooltip*.
- The title attribute is not the most accessible way to create tooltips.

### Hover States and Cursors

- Combine a pseudo-class with an element to change the styling based on the state of the object.
- `cursor` property lets you change the cursor type on the screen - this only changes on the hover, so you don't need to put it in a pseudo class

### Link States

- Links have four states
   1. :link
   2. :visited
   3. :hover
   4. :active
   - This is the order that they should appear on the sheet as well, this way the user receives the most applicable styling to the feedback that was received.

- Skeuomorphism
   - use `margin-top` to move a button down by 5px to make it look like itâ€™s being pressed, this would be paired with an :active psuedo
- `box-shadow:` takes two values
   - offset-x in px
   - offset-y in px
   - `box-shadow: 0px 2px`
- Flat Design:
