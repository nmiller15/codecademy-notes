# Wireframing

### What are Wireframes?

- A way for designers to communicate to developers.
- Wireframes omit implementation details, they donâ€™t have a lot of color or things, it is just an organized visual of the *structure* of the page
- Wireframes are concerned with usability
- A *mockup* will show more of the design. A wireframe is easier to build from, and the mockup will give more specific details.
- You can break down a wireframe into individual tasks so that there can be a development plan.

### From Design to Website

- Think about everything being a GRID.
- Think Visual Heirarchy
- Think Visual Continuity
- Web Design Workflow
   - Gather your content
   - Make design decisions
   - Add a style guide

   *now the hard work is done!*

Process

- Take it one section at a time
- Allow HTML and CSS to inform your layout
- Look for similarities and differences as you choose tags and selectors
- Be open to change

Suggestion

- Start with the HTML5 tags to define the sections of your site
- Take a global view
