# Color

### Introduction to Color

- Three ways to do color:
   - *named*
   - *RGB*
   - *HSL -* hue, saturation, lightness

### Foreground vs. Background

- This is addressed earlier

### Hexadecimal

- `#000000`
- This is a 15 digit system, rather than a 10
   - 10 digit - `0-9`
   - 15 digit - `0-F` where after 9 is A
- Put them in the exact same way that you put in named colors

### RGB Colors

- RGB syntax is `color: rgb(23, 45, 23);`
- Each number is an intensity value from 0 to 255 of red, green and blue respectively
- Whichever style you choose, just be consistent.

### Hue, Saturation, and Lightness

- `color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);`
   - hue - the angel on a color wheel
   - saturation- intensity or purity of the color
   - lightness - 50% is normal, it is the light or darkness of a color
- HSL is convenient for adjusting colors that you already have.
- I’m pretty sure that Mac OS has a color selector built in that will switch between all three of these, so you get the best of all them.

### Opacity and Alpha

- Add opacity to the HSL scheme with `hsla` - the a stands for alpha
- alpha is measured from 0 to 1, where 0 is transparent and 1 is opaque
- Think of alpha as “the amount of the background to mix with the foreground”
- RGB is similar: `rgba`
- Hex also has this - just add two (or one in the case of a 3 digit code) digits to the code where 00 is transparent and FF is opaque
- This cannot be added to named colors, but you can use the `transparent` keyword as a color
