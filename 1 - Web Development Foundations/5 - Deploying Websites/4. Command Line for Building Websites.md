# Command Line for Building Websites

## Navigation

### Introduction

- the **command line** passes commands to your computer's operating system
- in the command line you can navigate file systems, run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks.
- This is for unix-based systems (Linux and Mac OS X)
   - The UNIX brand has traditionally been applied to the family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T UNIX operating system, developed in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
- All the [commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands) from this course
- In the command line “folders” are *directories* and files and directories are organized into a *filesystem*

### Filesystem

- Tree structure is the filesystem that you're thinking of.
- The directory that contains all others, that is the parent of all others, is called the **root directory**.

### ls

- It is a lowercase L
- `ls` - will tell the OS to look at the directory you are in and then return a “list" of all the files and directories
- `$` - *shell prompt* this is the signal that the terminal is ready to receive a command

### pwd

- `pwd` - "print working directory", outputs the name of the directory that you are currently in

### cd

- `cd` - "change directory"
- This command receives an *argument*
   - An *argument* is a file, directory or program that is passed into a command.
   - i.e. `$ cd directoryName`
- You can use the argument `..` to move up a directory (you learned that this works for relative paths in HTML/CSS too)
- You can provide cd a relative path from where you currently are to the destination as an argument
   - `$ cd 2015/jan/memory`
- You can also use a slash to move up multiple directories `../..`
- You can also move to an adjacent directory using `..` and sepcifying a directory to move to.
   - `../2014` - It moves you first, back a level and then into the folder you selected

### mkdir

- `mkdir` - "make directory"
- Takes a directory name as an argument and then creates a new directory in the current owrking directory.
- You can make directories “remotely” by using relative paths as the argument
- `cd media` > `mkdir tv`
   - OR... `mkdir media/tv`

### touch

- `touch` creates new files inside the working directory and takes a filename as an argument

### Helper Commands

- You can use the tab key to autocomplete your command. It will autocomplete the name of an existing file or directory
- `clear` will clear you terminal window
- You can use arrow keys to move around the previeous commands, this will allow you to reexecute them from your current shell prompt

## Setting Up Command Line

- **Bash** - **B**ourne-**A**gain-**SH**ell
- CLI - commandl line interface (bash is one of these)
- Bash is open source and is the default shell for Linux and Mac
[Bash (Unix shell) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

- Windows runs on **Command Prompt** - it has many of the same features as bash but command promt us not used as much.
- You can use bash on a windows computer by installing **Git Bash**.
- `echo` can add text to a file, you can add `>>` to an argment to tell it to create a file as well
   - `echo "Hello`” `>> hello.txt` will create the hello.txt file with the text Hello in it
   - Make sure you close the quotes, because you can create multiple line files using this. if you’re in a quote and hit enter, it will say `dquote>` instead of giving you the shell prompt
- `cat` will print the text of the file that is passed to it through its argument
- `rm` - "remove" - will delete a file or directory
- `rm -r` - this will remove the directory AND all its contents
