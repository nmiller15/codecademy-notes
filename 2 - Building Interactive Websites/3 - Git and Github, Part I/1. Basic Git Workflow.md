# Basic Git Workflow

### The Power of Git and GitHub

- **Git** is a version control system, it helps for people to work collabratively.
- Git is a command line tool
- Git lets you create branches, which allow for the editing of code  without breaking the main branch.
- **Pull request** - a dedicated forum asking for critique on a branch before it goes live
- **Github** - hosts git online

### Hello Git

- Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes to a project over time.

### git init

- We can turn a file into a **git project** with `git init` or 'initialize'
   - This command sets up the tools needed for God to track changes
   - this is bash

### Git Workflow

- A Git project has 3 parts
   - a **working directory** - where the creating, editing, deleting and organizing of files happens
   - a **staging area** - where the changes made to the working directory are listed
   - a **repository** - where Git permanenetly stores changes as *versions*

### git status

- As you make changes, you can check the status of the contents of the working directory with `git status`

### git add

- For Git to start tracking the file needs to be added to the staging area.
- We do this with `git add` followed by a `filename`
- `git add filename`

### git diff

- Now that a file is tracked, we can make changes in the working directory and then check the differences between that and the staging area.
- `get diff filename`

### git commit

- A commit is the last step - a *commit* permenantly stores changes from the staging area in the repo
- commits are followed by a message - they have some standard conventions
   - must be in quotes
   - written in the present tense
   - should be brief (50 char or less when using `-m`
- `git commit -m â€œComplete first line of dialogue"`

### git log

- You may have to refer to an earlier version of a project. Commits are stored chronologically in the repo and you can view them with `git log`
