# Important Git Operations

### head commit

- most often the `HEAD` commit is the most recently made commit.
- you can see the `HEAD` commit by entering
   - `get show HEAD`
- This will show the head commitâ€™s identifiers, messageg, and the changes made to it when it was committed

### git checkout

- If you would like to revert to this commit you can type:
- `git checkout HEAD filename`
- This will restore the working directory to this version
- After running this, clost the file and reopen to see the HEAD restored.

### more git add

- You can add multiple files at once by separating their names with a space after the `git add` command

### git reset I

- We can clear the staging area and set it back to the head (imagine you added a file that is changed unrelated to the commit you are about to log.
- `git reset HEAD filename`

### git reset II

- `git reset commit_SHA`
- SHA is the first 7 digits of the SHA of a previous commit
- `git reset 5d69206` HEAD is now reset to this commit
- When you go back to a commit, any commits made after that commit are erased, you rewound the project
