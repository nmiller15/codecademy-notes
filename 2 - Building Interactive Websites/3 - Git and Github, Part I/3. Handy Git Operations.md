# Handy Git Operations

### Git stash

- You can store your work temporarily in a hidden directory with `$ git stash`
- This is useful for situations where you find a bug in a different file from an old commit that needs fixed, but you don’t want to lose you work, or if you are told to go work on another project.
- When you’re ready to come back to what you were working on, you can *pop* the work
- `$ git stash pop`

### Git log

- We've already talked about this but there are other commands associated that will help with some other things!
- `git log --oneline` - shows commits in one line format
- `git log -S "keyword"` - Will search for occurrences of your keyword in any file. If the number of your keyword has changed, it will show those commits
- `git lot --oneline --graph` - Displays a visual represetnation of how the branches and commits were created. `--graph` alone is very length so that is why `--oneline` is included here.

### Git command amend

- `--amend` allows you to update a commit, correct mistakes and edit rather than sending an entire new commit
- After you make changes, stage them with `git add` and then type `git commit --amend`  to update the previous commit
- This will actually completely replace the old commit, so you have to update the commit mesage
- If you want to keep the same message type: `$ git commit --amend --no-edit`

### Git alias commands

- Instead of using long terminal commands, you can use aliases
- You can set these yourself with the following syntax:

```other
$ git config --global alias.co "checkout"
$ git config --gloabl alias.br "branch"
$ git config --global alias.glop "log --pretty=format: "%h %s" --graph"
```

- So now if you want to check out to another branch, you can type

```other
$ git co example_branch
```

- instead of

```other
$ git checkout example_branch
```
