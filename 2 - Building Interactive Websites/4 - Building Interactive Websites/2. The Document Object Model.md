# The Document Object Model

### What is the DOM?

- Document Object Model - Browsers internal representation of a webpage
- Document - web page
- Object - the stuff (nodes, elements) in a document
- Model - a representation of something, helps us understand how itâ€™s put together
- Source code gets converted to a DOM gets converted to a webpage.

### Nodes and Elements in the DOM

- A node is a family member in a family tree - it's a point in the tree that contains data.
- Element notes are representations of page elements
- Text notes are representations of the text inside elements.
- Script will most often interact with element notes and occasionally with text nodes

### Attributes of Element Node

- The DOM allows us to access a node's attributes (class, id, style, etc)
- If access an element node in our script, then the DOM will allow us to tweak each of the attributes, or let us check their value
