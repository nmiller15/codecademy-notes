# HTML Forms

### How a Form Works

- HTTP requests tell our computers how to communicate when sending information back and forth.
- `<form>` is a way of collecting information from a user, but that information still needs processed somewhere
   - `<form>` needs to be supplied with the location of the information and what request to make... here's an example:

```html
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  </form>
```

   - This will send info to "example.html" using the action attribute
   - This will use a POST request using a method attribute (POST doesn’t need to be capitalized, but that is the convention)
- We will contain things like a title and description within the form element as well as elements to collect user input.

### Text Input

- To create an input field we will use the `<input>` element. This will get a `type` attribute to determine how it will be rendered.
- `type='text'` will create a text field that a user can type into - this is the default value
- ALL INPUTS MUST HAVE A `name` ATTRIBUTE! Without it a form won't be submitted

```html
<form action='/example.html' method='POST'>
  <input type='text' name='first-text-field'>
</form>
```

- After something is typed and submitted into the form, then that submission becomes the `value`  attribute.
   - `value` and `name` are then paired
- To prefill, assign something to the value attribute in the code

### Adding a Label

- We can use a `label` element to properly explain what the `input` is used for.
- If you want to associate a lable and an input, you must give an `id` to an `<input>` and then assign the attribute, `for` to the same value for the `<label>`

```html
<form action='/example.html' method= "POST">
  <label for='meal'>What do you want to eat?</label>
  <br>
  <input type='text' name='food' id='meal'>
</form>
```

### Password Input

- There is a `type='password'` which will keep the input from being seen by anyone!
- Even though the text is visually obscured, there’s no other security provided by this input type, it will still send clear text with the other information in the form

### Number Input

- If we want users to input a number:
   - `type="number"`
- Add a `step` attribute that will create arrows that allowt he user to increase the value by the value of the `step`

```html
<!--insde a form> -->
<input id="years" name="years" type="number" step="1">
```

- Sections are often used to separate each section of the form to help it stay organized and also help browsers read the page more easily

### Range Input

- If we want to limit the numerical inputs a user could give by using a slider:
   - `type="range"`
   - Also must give a `min` and `max` attribute to the `<input>`
   - `step` will change how fluidly the slider will move

```html
<input id="volume" name="volume" type="range"
  min="0" max="100" step="1">
```

### Checkbox Input

- Use checkboxes to give multiple options and allow them to select any number of options:

```html
<form>
  <p>Choose your pizza toppings:</p>
  <label for="cheese">Extra cheese</label>
  <input id="cheese" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="cheese">
  <br>
  <label for="pepperoni">Pepperoni</label>
  <input id="pepperoni" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="pepperoni">
  <br>
  <label for="anchovy">Anchovy</label>
  <input id="anchovy" name="topping" type="checkbox" value="anchovy">
</form>
```

- There are assigned values to the `value` attribute of the checkboxes, these values aren't visible - This tells the computer what to pass - this is also why it's important to include a label

### Radio Button Input

- Like checkboxes but will only allow one selection

```html
<form>
  <p>What is sum of 1 + 1?</p>
  <label for="two">2</label>
  <input type="radio" id="two" name="answer" value="2">
  <br>
  <label for="eleven">11</label>
  <input type="radio" id="eleven" name="answer" value="11">
</form>
```

### Dropdown list

- `<select>`
   - `<option>`

```html
<form>
  <label for="lunch">What's for lunch?</label>
  <select id="lunch" name="lunch">
    <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
    <option value="curry">Curry</option>
    <option value="salad">Salad</option>
    <option value="ramen">Ramen</option>
    <option value="tacos">Tacos</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

- When information is sent, the name from `<select>` is paired with the value from `<option>`

### Datalist Input

- If we have lots of information in a list that would be tedious for a user to search, then we can add a `<datalist>` element that will be tied to an `<input type="text"` element

```html
<form>
  <label for="city">Ideal city to visit?</label>
  <input type="text" list="cities" id="city" name="city">

  <datalist id="cities">
    <option value="New York City"></option>
    <option value="Tokyo"></option>
    <option value="Barcelona"></option>
    <option value="Mexico City"></option>
    <option value="Melbourne"></option>
    <option value="Other"></option>
  </datalist>
</form>
```

- To pair to the `<input>` you have to use a `list` attribute on the input. This works like the `for` attribute for labels.
- A datalist, by default is not validated, so it provides a list of values that a user *could* select, but their own input could still be passed as the value.
- This examply did put any text in the option, but it seems to display the value just fine.

### Textarea element

- `type="text"` by default only creates a single row input field for users.
- `<textarea>` can be used to create a bigger text field for users to write mroe text
   - `rows` - how many rows
   - `cols` - how many columns

```html
<form>
  <label for="blog">New Blog Post: </label>
  <br>
  <textarea id="blog" name="blog" rows="5" cols="30">
  </textarea>
</form>
```

- Rows and cols determines how it will render at first, but there will also be an option for users to click and drag to open the area.
- If you wanted to add default text, add it between the `<textarea>` opening and closing tags
- You can also use the `placeholder` attribute to add clear text that will automatically disappear. This however, not the most accessible or veratile, and should only be used to give a user a *hint* as to the type of information that goes inside and not as a replacement for a proper `<label>`

### Submit Form

- The value of the `type="submit"` will be placed in the button used to submit the form.

```html
<form>
  <input type="submit" value="Send"> 
</form>
```
