# Form Validation

### Introduction to HTML Form Validation

- *Validation* is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data!
- There is *server-side* and *client-side* validation.

### Requiring an Input

- `required`

### Set a Minimum and Maximum Value

- You can use `min` and `max` attributes to assign acceptable values to a number field like a `type="number"` or a `type="range"`

```html
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="guests">Enter # of guests:</label>
  <input id="guests" name="guests" type="number"
    min="1" max="4">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Checking Text Length

- `minlength`
- `maxlength`

### Matching a Pattern

- We can also have HTML validation for regular expressions by using the `pattern`
- If we wanted to check for a valid credit card, we could use the expression `[0-9]{14-16}`
   - This will check that the user only provided numbers and that they entered at least 14 and at most 16 digits

```html
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
  <br>
  <input id="payment" name="payment"
    type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Regular Expressions

[](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/regexp?page_ref=catalog)

- There are two methods of creating RegExp objects.
   - literal notation, using slashed to delimit patterns
   - uses the RegExp constructor which takes a pattern followed by a flag.
- The above link has instructions on how to create these strings
