# Accessibility

### Introduction to Accessibility

- Screen readers will read off all the content on a site for those who are viusally impaired.
- The Web Accessibility Initiative (led by W3C) is about making the internet accessible for all people.
- Standards are set by guidelines called Accessible Rich Internet Applications, or ARIA
[WAI-ARIA - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA)

   - The 5 Rules of ARIA
      1. Don’t use ARIA if you can achieve the same semantics with a native HTML element or attribute.
      2. Do not change the semantics of native HTML (unless you really have to)
      3. All interactive ARIA controls must be usable with the keyboard.
      4. Do not remove semantics or hide focusable elements.
      5. Ensure all interactive elements have an accessible name.

### Semantic HTML Elements

- Wherever possible, use a semantic HTML element.

### ARIA Role

- We can use the attribute `role` to give more context to the information that is on a website.
[](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#conformance)

- There is a list of acceptable or conforming roles that objects can play, stick to these
- Allowed Decendants: [https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-descendants-of-aria-roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-descendants-of-aria-roles)

### ARIA Role: Presentation

- Some elements just serve to organize information, like an ordered list. If we set the `role="presentation"` then we don't have to worry about the screen reader reading "ordered list"
- If the name of the element itself isn’t needed to understand the context, use this.

### ARIA Properties

- Sometimes an image will have a caption beneath it. With the image there, it might be clear why the caption is there, but to a screen reader it might not be clear.
- We cna add an `aria-label` property which can give the screen reader additional information to read out loud.

```html
<img src="#" alt="A painting of the Shenandoah Valley"/>
<p aria-label="Artist">Armand Cabrera, 2010</p>
```

Here’s a completel list of ARIA properties:

### Alt attribute

- The `alt` attribute works like an `aria-label` but has more function, including being a safeguard in case images aren't displayed.
- `aria-label`s will never be displayed on screen
- `alt` attribute conventions:
   1. Concicely describe the image
   2. If the image is also an anchor, also describe the source.
   3. If the image is purely decorative (like a border) the alt should be empty, but not omitted.
   4. If text near an image describes it, then leave an emtpy alt, do not duplicate the description.
   5. alts should be less than 150 characters
