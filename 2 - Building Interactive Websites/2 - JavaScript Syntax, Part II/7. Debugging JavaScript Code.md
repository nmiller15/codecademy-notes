# Debugging JavaScript Code

### Thinking About Errors Differently in Your Code

- The more that you program the more errors you will encounter and deal with!
- Errors mean you’re trying to do something complex and they’re an opportunity to learn.
1. #### Dissect the Error
   - There is a description of the error itself and then the line that it occured on
   - Errors come up in a *stack-trace*
   - The second line points to the file and then the line and character that threw the error
1. #### Is the Solution in the Error?
   - It will sometimes point to the line that has the error, and even the character where the error was thrown, but this might not be the *wrong* character, you'll have to look around.
1. #### Search on the Web for Instances of This Error
2. #### Compare Different Use Cases to Yours
3. #### Try to Implement the Solution

### Error Stack Traces

### JavaScript Error Types

- **SyntaxError** - invalid code - The compiler cannot interpret the code
- **ReferenceError** - using a variable that doesn't exist
- **TypeError** - attempt to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type

### Locating Silent Bugs

- Add print statements systematically through your code to check for bugs in code logic.

### Debugging with console.log()

1. Go to malfunctioning code and print all starting variables, existing values, and arguments. If these are what you expect then move on to the next piece of logic. If they aren't then this is a bug, skip to step 3.
2. After the next piece of log, print any variables that should have changed. Repeat this step until you find something that is not working as expected.
3. Fix the bug and run code again.
