# Higher-Order Functions

### Introduction

- **Higher-order functions** are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output.
- **abstration** - the leaving out of many details in order to communicate the same idea more concisely - in programming we can do this with functions and well-named functions
   - Using abstraction allows us to write more modular code, making it easier to read and debug

### Functions as Data

- Functions are objects, *first-class objects,* meaning that they have properties such as `.length` and `.name` and they have methods such as `.toString()`
- Functions can be treated like any other type of data in JS meaning that you can assign them to variables and reassign them etc

```javascript
const announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = () => {
  console.log('I\'m doing very important work.');
};
// ^ This function name is too long.

const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork;

busy(); // Calls the first function.
// Allows us to reassign the function without
// altering source code
```

### Functions as Parameters

- Functions can be passed to other functions as parameters. Functions that take other functions as parameters are referred to as *higher-order functions*
- The function being used as a parameter is called a callback function.

```javascript
const higherOrderFunc = param => {
  param();
  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`;
}

const anotherFunc = () => {
  return 'I\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';
}

higherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);
```

- When a function is passed into another function, it is done by passing in the function name without parentheses.
- We can also pass anonymous functions into a higher order function

```javascript
higherOrderFunc( () => {
  return 'I\'m an anonymous function.'
  }
);
```
