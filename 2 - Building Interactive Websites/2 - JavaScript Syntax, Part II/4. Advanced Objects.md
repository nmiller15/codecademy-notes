# Advanced Objects

### The this Keyword

- Inside of methods in an object, you don't automatically have access to the properties of the object.
- However, if we conbine the property with the `this` keyword, then we can access it.

```javascript
const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbibore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
}

goat.diet();
// Output: herbivore
```

- `this` references the *calling object* and provides access to the calling object's properties
- When a method is run, it is technically being run outside of the scope of that object, not within (like a conditional or a loop) - so that’s why we need to tell it what object to access - `this` is good shorthand.

### Arrow Functions and this

- `this` will not work when a method is an arrow function.
- The arrow function *binds* an already defined `this` value to the function that is not the calling object.
- Don’t use arrow functions when using `this` in a method.

### Privacy

- **Privacy in objects** is the idea that only certain properties in the object should be mutable, or able to change in value.
- Some languages have privacy built in, but JS doesn’t.
- JS devs follow naming conventions that signal to other dexs how to interact with a property.
- Using the underscore `_` before a property name can indicate that it shouldn’t be altered.

```javascript
const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}
```

- You can still reassign it though.
- We will have to use *getters* and *setters* to respect these intentions.

### Getters

- Methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. (They can do more than just retrieve though).
- Getters, when called, use the same syntax as calling a property. It is a method though.
- Advantages to using getters:
   - can perform an action on the data when getting a property
   - Can return different values using conditionals.
   - A getter can access the other properties of the calling object with `this`
   - Functionality is easier to see and understand.
- A property cannot share a name with the getter method

```javascript
const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a lst name.';
    }
  }
}
// Call getter method:
person.fullName; // 'John Doe'
```

### Setters

- These reassign values of existing properties within an object.
- Setter methods also do not need to be called with parentheses.

```javascript
const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age.');
    }
  }
}

// Call the method
person.age = 40;
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 40
person.age = '40'; // Logs 'You must asign a number to age.'

// Doesn't totally protect
person._age = 'forty-five';
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 'forty-five'
```

### Factory Functions

- Factory functions allow us to create a template of sorts for an object. We can use parameters for the function to customize objects. Calling a factory function will allow us to create objects without creating an object literal every time

```javascript
const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    energySource: energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    }
  }
};

const ghost = monsterFactor('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
ghost.scare(); // BOO!
```

### Property Value Shorthand

- We don't actually have to repeat the name of the value if it matches the key since ES6
- This functions the same way as the above:

```javascript
const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return {
    name,
    age, 
    energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    }
  }
};
```

### Destructured Assignment

- We will sometimes want to assign an object's property value to a variable. We can do that like this:

```javascript
const vampire = {
  name: 'Dracula',
  residence: 'Transylvania',
  preferences: {
    day: 'stay inside',
    night: 'satisfy appetite'
  }
};

const residence = vampire.residence;
console.log(residence); // 'Transylvania'
```

- We can rewrite this assignment more quickly with **destructured assignment** when the variable and the property have the same name:

```javascript
const { residence } = vampire;
console.log(residence); // 'Transylvania'
```

- Can also work with nested objects

```javascript
const { day } = vampire.preferences;
console.log(day); // 'stay inside'
```

### Built-in Object Methods

- We can write methods, but objects also have many methods built in. Lean on documentation to learn these.
- There are also Object class methods which can be called by passing objects into them.
