# Objects

### Introduction to Objects

- Objects are the seventh data type in JavaScript.
- JavaScrip objects are containers storing related data and functionality.
- Many of the things that we’ve already done are done through pre-built objects, but we can also create our own objects to use.

### Creating Object Literals

- Objects can be assigned to variables.
- An **object literal** is designated with curlies

```javascript
let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object
```

- Objects are filled with unordered data that are sorted into **key-value pairs**,
- A key has an *identifier*, or name followed by a colon and then a value of any data type.
- All key-value pairs should be separated with a comma.

```javascript
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color:'silver'
}
```

   - The object is called `spaceship`
   - Each key-value pair is a *property*
   - The keys are `'Fuel Type'` and `color`
   - The values are `'diesel'` and `'silver'`
- Keys are strings, but if a key doesn't ahve a special character in it (like a space) we can omit the quotation marks.

### Accessing Properties

- We can use dot notation `.` to access and objects properties. We have already done this to access properties and methods of built-in objects and data instances
- Dot notation syntax is - object name, followed by the dot operator and then the propery name (key)

```javascript
let spaceship = {
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  color: 'silver'
};
spaceship.homePlanet; // Returns 'Earth'
spaceship.color // Returns 'silver'
```

- If you access a property that doesn't exist, it will return `undefined`

### Bracket Notation

- We have used this to access indexes in an array.
- We must use bracked notation with accessing keys that have numbers, spaces, or special characters in them. i.e.
   - `spaceship['Fuel Type'];`
- You can also put a variable in the brackets, which is useful in conjuction with functions

```javascript
let returnAnyProperty = (objectName, propertyName) => {
  objectName[propertyName];
}

returnAnyProperty(spaceship, 'homePlanet');
// Returns 'Earth'
```

   - In this example, we can't use dot notation, becase it would look for a *key* of 'propertyName' on our object and not the value of the `propertyName` parameter

### Property Assignment

- We can use dot operators or bracket notation with the assignment operator to mutate our objects.

```javascript
const spaceship = {type: 'shuttle'};
spaceship = {type: 'alien'}; 
  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
spaceship.type = 'alien'; 
  // Changes value of the type propert
spaceship.speed = 'Mach 5';
  // Creates a new key of 'speed' with a value of 
  // 'Mach 5'
```

- You can also delete a property from an object like this:

```javascript
delete spaceship.speed
// Removes the speed property
```

### Methods

- When the data stored on an object is a function, that is called a *method*
- We create methods in object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs.
- Key: Method’s name
- Value: anonymous function expression

```javascript
const alienShip = {
  invade: function () {
    console.log("Hello! We have come to dominate.")
  }
} // We can omit 'function' and the colon since ES6
  // invade () { ... }

alienShip.invade();
```

- When putting in multiple methods, don't forget to separate them with a comma, like the properties.

### Nested Objects

- You can put objects inside of other objects
- When objects and properties are nested, we can use chain operators to access them.

```javascript
const spaceship = {
  telescope: {
    yearBuilt: 2018,
    model: '91031-XLT',
    focalLength: 2032
  },
  crew: {
    captain: {
      name: 'Sandra',
      degree: 'Computer Engineering',
      encourageTeam () {console.log('We got this!')}
    }
  },
  engine: {
    model: 'Nimbus2000'
  },
  nanoelectronics: {
    computer: {
      terabytes: 100,
      monitors: 'HD'
    },
    'back-up': {
      battery: 'Lithium',
      terabytes: 50
    }
  }
};

//Chain operators
spaceship.nanoelectroncis['back-up'].battery 
// 'Lithium'
```

### Pass By Reference

- Objects are 'passed by reference' meaning that when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.
- Functions which change object properties acutlaly mutate the object permanently (even if it has a `const`)

```javascript
const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};
 
let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};
 
paintIt(spaceship);
 
spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'
```

- When passed into a function, an object is not the same as a variable. It is more accurately a map to where the information of the object is stored. It cannot be reassigned in a function body, because a reference to the information is passed into the body, not technically a variable.
- Essentially, you can not reassign an object within a function:

```javascript
let spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'red'
};
let tryReassignment = obj => {
  obj = {
    identified : false, 
    'transport type' : 'flying'
  }
  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
};

tryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.
spaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};
 
spaceship = {
  identified : false, 
  'transport type': 'flying'
}; // Regular reassignment still works.
```

### Looping Through Objects

- Even though objects aren't ordered (meaning that we can't iterate through them), JS has another solution
   - `for...in` loop syntax

```javascript
let spaceship = {
  crew: {
    captain: { 
      name: 'Lily', 
      degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
      cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
    },
    'chief officer': { 
      name: 'Dan', 
      degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
      agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
    },
    medic: { 
      name: 'Clementine', 
      degree: 'Physics', 
      announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
      name: 'Shauna', 
      degree: 'Conservation Science', 
      powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
    }
  }
}; 

// for...in
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`);
}
```

- `for...in` will iterate through each element of the `spaceship.crew` object. The new variable `creMember` will be set to one of the `spaceship.crew`'s keys, enabling us to log a list of crew members' role and `name`
