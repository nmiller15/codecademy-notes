# Variables

- A **variable** is a container for a **value**.
- Information stored in variables can be retrieved in memory.
- Variables also allow us to give descriptive names to data
- Variables are NOT values, but the contain values and represent them with a name.

### Create a Variable: var

- Since ES6 there are two new keywords to *declare* or create variables.
   - `let` -
   - `const`
   - Pre-ES6 was only `var` - short for variable, a JS keyword that creates a new variable

```javascript
var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya
```

- `=` - this is the *assignment operator*
- A way to verbalize the first line of code is “The variable ‘myName’ was *initialized* with a value of ‘Arya’.
- Naming rules for variables
   - Cannot start with a number
   - Are case-sensitive: myName and myname are different
   - Cannot be a keyword - check documentation if you suspect it might be a keyword

### Create a Variable: let

- `let` also assigns variables, but it signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value

```javascript
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito
```

- With `let` and `var` we can create variables without a value, if you create a valueless variable it will automatically be `undefined`

```javascript
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
```

### Create a Variable: const

- `const` is short for constant and it lets you stor any value in a created variable, but a const cannot be reassigned it is *constant*
- Constant variables must be assigned a value when you create them. You will get a `SyntaxError` if you don’t.

### Mathematical Assignment Operators

```javascript
let w = 4;
w = w + 1;

console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

You can also do it this way

```javascript
let w = 4;
w += 1;

console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

- The second statment is essentially:
   - start with `w`
   - `+=` perform addition and assign to the variable
   - using the provided value `1`
- Here are some others `-=` `*=` `/=`

### The Increment and Decrement Operator

- Increment operator `++` - increase value of the variable by 1
- Decrement operator `--` - decrease balue of the variable by 1

```javascript
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11

let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
```

### String Concatenation with Variables

- Use the `+` operator to contatenate strings with variables.

### String Interpolation

- You can also insert or *interpolate* variables into strings using what's called a *template literal.*

```javascript
const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`)
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.
```

- A template literal:
   - is wrapped by backticks ``` this is on the tilde key (~)
   - contains a placeholder, `${myPet}`. The value of `myPet` is inserted.

### typeof operator

- the `typeof` operator checks the value to its right and *returns*, or passes back, a string of the data type

```javascript
const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string

const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number

const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean
```
