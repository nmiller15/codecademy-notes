# Functions

### What are Functions?

- In programming, we will often have to perform the same task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task. That way we can reuse it.
- We do this with a **function** - a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a task.

### Function Declarations

- A **function declaration** is one way to create a function in JavaScript.

```javascript
function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

- Here are the parts of a function declaration:
   - `function` keyword
   - The name of the function followed by parentheses
   - A function body, or the block of statements that will perform the task in curlies
- The function declaration creates a function tied to an identifier, or name.
- JavaScript allows *hoisting*, which allows access to a function declaration before it's defined.

```javascript
greetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!

function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

- This is NOT good practice, however.

### Calling a Function

- Declaring a function doesn't cause it to run *calling* it does. In the above example, line 1 is *calling* the function greetWorld()

### Parameters and Arguments

- Our functions can accept inputs, but to do that, we must define **parameters**, we will do that in the function declaration.
- If we wanted a function to accept a value for `width` and a value for `height` we would write

```javascript
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  console.log(width * height);
}
```

Within the function block, the parameters are treated just like variables.

And we would call the function with **arguments**, the values for these parameters:

```javascript
calculateArea(2, 5); // Console logs 10
```

### Default Parameters

- These were added in 2015 with ES6
- **Default parameters** allow parameters to have a predetermined value in case no argument is passed into the function, or if the argument is `undefined`.
- To set a default parameter, you will set an `=` operator accross from the value

```javascript
function greeting(name = 'stranger'){
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);  
}

greeting('Nick'); // Output: Hello, Nick!
greeting(); // Output: Hello, stranger!
```

### Return

- The default return for a function is `undefined`
- Many times we may want information back from our function, we can do that with a `return` statement in the function.
- `return` also acts as a `break` in a conditional, it will stop anything after the line it's on (within the function) from executing.
- In short, `return` allows functions to produce **output**

### Helper Functions

- You can use the return value of a function inside another function. The function being called from inside another function is called a *helper function*.
- This means that we can create smaller functions that do bits and pieces of things so that they can be more usable globally. This allows us to combine them!

### Function Expressions

- We can also define functions in *function expressions*, the name is usually ommitted here creating an *anonymous function*. They are usually stored in a variable in order to refer to it.

```javascript
//Declare a variable, so that it can be the identifier of the function
//Set an anonymous function as the value
const calculateArea = function(width, height) {
  const area = width * height;
  return area
}

//To call ---
// variableName(argument1, argument2);
calculateArea(8, 9);
```

- Function expressions are not hoisted, they must be defined first.

### Arrow Functions

- ES6 introduced a new syntax called **arrow function syntax**
- It is a shorter way to write functions using a “fat” arrow
- It keeps you from having to write out the word `function`

```javascript
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};
```

### Concise Body Arrow Functions

- There are also several ways to refactor arrow function syntax.
   1. If the function only has a single parameter, it doesn't need to be in parentheses.

```javascript
// Zero Parameters
const functionName = () => {};
// One Parameter
const functionName = paramOne => {};
// Two or More Parameters
const functionName = (paramOne, paramTwo) => {};
```

   1. If the function body is a single-line block, then you don’t need curly braces, whatever the line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow and the `return` keyword can be removed.

```javascript
// Single-line block
const sumNumbers = number => number + number;
// Multi-line block
const sumNumbers = number => {
  const sum = number + number;
  return sum;
}
```
